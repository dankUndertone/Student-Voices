# General Conclusions: Themes in The Text

We used the bubble graphs (pyLDAvis graphs), descriptive labels and dominant topic distributions (from the tables above and in each trail) to identify themes that appear consistently in the data, and how often they appear. We focus primarily on the trial with the highest average coherence (DC:A1, RL100) which we will call `EX2`. We will seek out these themes in the other trials beginning with the next most coherent trial (DC:E1, RL100) which we will call `EX3`, followed by the 4th trial called `EX4` (DC:E1, RL:150) which, when we only consider the most populous topics has an average coherence score of .49 which is close to the best (see `Experimental Outcome 4`). Finally we will look at the fourth trial which only highlighted 10 topics and had the lowest coherence score, we will call this trial `EX1`.

### Theme 1: Overworked & Undergrade (15% of bad reviews)

Check the bubble graph for `EX2` and you will see that topics 1 & 15 clustered together. Topic 1 covered complaints about teachers who were considered harsh graders and students who generally felt overworked. Student reviews dominated by Topic 15 also reflected stressed out students who felt unprepared and complained about poor grades, except reviews in this topics included warning to other students "SWITCH OUT." Nearby was topic 11 in which students described their classes as pointless wastes of time. All together topics 1, 11 & 15 dominated 15.3% of the 0-35 corpus (~32,000 reviews; 7.9%, 4.2% & 3.2% respectively). 

***Note***: *Rather than group them together, we allowed for some differentiation between topics that followed similar themes. This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of both, the reviewers perceptions and the distributions of the same. Theme 2 was the first case where we made this distinction.*


### Theme 2.A: Out of Touch - Poor Alignment (15%-19%) 

The bubble graph for `EX2` showed a that topics 2, 3 & 12 clustered together. Reviews dominated by topic 2 critisized teachers inability to prepare students or align tests and classwork. Topic 3 discussed teachers' who had unrealistic expectations and whose explanations left students feeling confused. The overlap between 2 & 3 is evident and together they covered about 15% of reviews. Topic 12 (~4.2%) described teachers as "the worst" without much detail, suggesting that the teachers that most often earned the description of "worst" were those who were out of touch with their students.

### Theme 2.B: Out of Touch - Unhelpful Teachers & Staff (7%)  

Topic 13 highlighted teachers who would not or could not help students. Topic 14 described staff, administrators and teachers who were unable to run a school or classroom in such ways that benefitted students. The overall sentiment seems to highlight high opportunity cost and a general frustration at not being supported. Both topics aproximate the cluster for *Theme 2.A* but hover just above it. Together, topics 13 & 14 take up 7% of the reviews (3.8% & 3.2%). 

### Theme 3.A: Unfit  - Petty, Immature & Unfocused








### Theme 3 - Good Time, Bad Teacher (9%) 

Another consistent theme was that of the teacher who didn't make students suffer but were also perceived to fail as teachers. Topic 10 dominated reviews of classes that were easy "A"s but students complained of not learning anything or being unprepared for higher levels. Topic 19 dominated reviews of teachers who were perceived as kind or cool but inadequate as teachers. Students didn't hate them because they didn't fail them but they didn't love them because they didn't teach them. Topic 21 captured sarcasm, positive reviews (erroneously submitted as bad) or teachers who were bad relative to other teachers. All together topics 10, 19 & 21 took up 9% of reviews (4.3%, 2.7% and 2% respectively). 


### Theme 4 - Teacher or Powerpoint? 

Topics 23 & 24 both discussed teachers that depended heavily on notes, books, powerpoints, videos and other materials. Teachers' strategies revolved around memorization, students felt they had to teach themselves and that teachers were inflexible when it came to deviating from the material. Together both these topics made up just under 1% of reviews (.57% & .38%).
