1300,What kind of Gym teacher rides a golf cart while making all the students run a mile should he be in shape too?
1398,"She makes up here own rules or else goes overboard on existing rules and when you cross her you've crossed her for life. She also goes straight to the principal a quote from another student is ""its not my problem, you just can't do whatever you are doing"" that about sums up her attitude."

1599,"Shields sure is nowhere near a perfect teacher, but he's a worse coach. If you aren't top of JV or Varsity on the XC or Track team, he won't even talk to you. Acts like everyone should be fast as him and won't even stand constructive criticism. Best day was when Andy Hille cussed him out on his last day of track practice as a senior. Pure gold.

1998,"Parents, don't walk... Run!!! Keep your children away from this narcasistic, lying, control freak. The teacher's union is the only reason she's still employed!!"
1999,I think Chuck is unfair in his coaching practices. He loves to intimidate his players as opposed to gaining their respect through his coaching techniques. He also loves to brag about what he owns.

2098,airhead at controlling her school. spends too much $$ on trees when we need better things for the classrooms.

2100,She has the easiest job in the world. All she has to do is go in a classroom and sleep while she pretends to be working.
2498,As a Varsity High School baseball coach he is simply not committed to the team. He is unable to demand respect from his players because of his childish ways and will easily give up on a kid or the tea
