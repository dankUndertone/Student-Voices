468,Ms. Mills knows nothing about the human body! If I had her as my nurse I would have ran screaming out of the doctor's office!!
501,A fairly hypocritical principal. She yelled at us for getting up to throw trash away and then yelled at us for not throwing trash away.

769,The most enlightened member of the staff. Patently transparent without a hidden agenda. All around good guy who is gentle and fair.

1505,Has driven away many older teachers. Is unfair in dealings with students and faculty. Has hurt the reputation of the school.
1538,Big phony. Kids can't read when they leave her class. Parents think she's great because everyone gets A's & A+'s. She should work more and gossip less.

2140,i cant believe they still have her teaching art (thank god shes not a dean or else the case room will become the size of a normal class room)
