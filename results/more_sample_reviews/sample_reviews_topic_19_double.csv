713,"History is hi-STORY, not daily boring class set activities, videos from Schlessinger, giving homework questions found in the textbook word for word, and getting tested on obscure material on page 423 1/2 of the textbook. He is the laziest teacher I have ever met. He uses a test generator, he copies and pastes homework questions from the book, and he gives class sets so he doesn't have to re-pass out boring activities that he says are ""going to be great!"" -.- I hate Mr. Small...."
727,Mr. Bertani's tiny handwriting is just an excuse to get away with writing Van Halen lyrics as lesson plans. AP History was an absolute joke.

807,Obsessed with taking notes. She won't even answer questions if you don't show your notes first. Gives tests over notes. Worst teacher at OHS. MEAN.

1036,Mr. Gustin has very little knowledge beyond the absolute bare minimum. He reads the power points word for word to the class and typically evades any questions by rephrasing the question back to the class. He has outright admitted that he doesn't read the notes before class. He has a false sense of entitlement. He gets all of his tests from online and has no idea what's on them. I honestly would be better off if I had no teacher at all in that class.
1050,"She described my son's Alan Parson's Project as being ""wildly inappropriate"" and took points off for things that made no sense, but when I asked for a copy of the performance she essentially refused."
1063,she give's too many reading comprehensions and too many facts to write..how about teaching the chapter for once
1077,where to start. she has a horrible grading system. we do like 30 assignments and then we have a binder check and all she does is see if we did them. her homework consists of reading passages and REWRITING WORD FOR FREAKIN WO
