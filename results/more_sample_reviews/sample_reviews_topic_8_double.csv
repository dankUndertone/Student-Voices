1470,"Feigenbaum- is a nice lady but an awful teacher. Her discussions go virtually nowhere, in fact, their almost completely content-less. Although she attempts at ""social programming"", it's ineffective."

1810,Mr. Archangel has very little knowledge of the subject matter that he teaches. He has lectured on subjects many times and has to be constantly corrected by the students. Additionally he consistently interjects not fact but rather opinion into world and national events but tries to pass them off as fact. He's typically prepared for class and often seems as if he's trying to figure out what we are supposed to be doing. Grading policies are never objective but very subjective. Bad...just bad.

2489,"Mr. Mikula has greater than 70% of his students consistently failing his class. He does not provide any quality instruction. For example, his teaching method is primarily look in the textbook answer the questions, if you can't figure it out on your own...too bad for you. He takes no ownership of the results of his instruction. So much for accountability...huh? I hope they bring charter school funding so some kids like me can get good math instruction. He does not know or care about us."
2545,Armada's class aint the kind of class I find that would make my life easier in the future but it has improved my vocabulary. I dont have much to say. It's very unclear.

2715,"She focuses on too much critiquing, and not actually getting hands on with the subject. wish i got garner"

2998,I absolutely would recommend this teacher! Lovely personality and beautiful hair! I love her teaching style! Her class was EXTREMELY good; the teaching style was truly impeccable! She is perhaps one of the most knowledgeable persons I have ever had the privilege of meeting! She is as knowledgable as the Renaissance polymaths of Da Vinci and greater!
3055,"I failed this class because she wouldn't show me how to export my final exam so I had to take a 0. She lacks review time, is untruthful, mean, and unintelligent. Her degree is in chemistry"
3111,He is absent from class often and is unclear and imprecise in his lessons. i have learned more on my own than from his class.

3224,"Nicole is a very interesting teacher. although she tends to sit back and let the students do the teaching, she still is a very enjoyable person to be around."

3394,"He knew the material but failed to present it in an interesting way, and did not do well explaining it.. He was always disorganized and usually pretty moody."
3451,"Extremely unorganized and clearly poorly equipped to teach an online class. Seems pretty lazy to just attach a calendar to the syllabus and expect everyone to go about their business without any instruction. She opened a quiz without ever announcing it. Really not looking forward to the rest of the class. I currently have another online class in which the teacher is extremely active, involved, and helpful. Not this lady, though."
3507,She can be very condescending and often gets lost in the middle of an explanation and gets students often lost. She does try to be very helpful but often confused students rather than helped them.
3564,He's not a teacher - he's a chiropractor. He conducts his class unprofessionally. he thinks that it's more important to fool around with the students than to teach them.
3620,"Oh gosh where do i start, first off she may have had all the good intentions in the world but that just doesn't make up for letting the talented students teach the entire course. She taught subject ma"
3677,"She is very useless teacher, and I would probably learn more from a rock. In addition, her tests are difficult not because of the content, but instead, of her incompetency of teaching correct and relevant materials. Many times, she grades in a very unfair manner, and tends to give much higher scores (up to 20%) to students she likes more. Also, she is very boring and does not answer questions clearly. If you get this teacher, good luck (because you will need it)."
3733,"honestly and solely on the basis of his teaching ability, he is the worst. he was unhelpful in and outside of the classroom. he clearly spends more time crafting his dull wit than his lessons."
3790,"The worst teacher I have had. Although I was one of the quicker students in her class, the only reason I passed the regents was by reteaching myself the year. F"
3847,does not know the subject matter at all! the only classroom she should be in is one where she is being taught the material by a PROFESSIONAL
3903,Made me drop physics. He should have retired long ago. Science is incredibly interesting and should be taught with enthusiasm and passion. Garland didn't do either. Try to get a different teacher!!
3960,"The topics that we are covering seem easy, but she is making it 20 times harder!"
4016,One of the most disorganized teachers I have ever had. I thiink he gets rigid because he is so disorganized. Not a whole lot of intellectual steam.
4073,Has her head up in the clouds. Very difficult to learn from. Very unclear. Often annoying. (But I suppose she is also a nice person.)
4129,"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach and never answers questions, only leaves the students more confused. He also reiterates everything that isn't important. He once attempted to teach us something even he didn't know how to do, leaving all of the students angry and confused. He uses the textbook to teach. As in, he reads right off it. He has no structured class and cannot manage time. He mumbles to himself and is quite rude too sometimes."
4186,"This man has absolutely no idea how to teach, much less in chemistry (which he apparently failed three times in college.) One of the more veteran teachers has to come in and teach him new concepts."
4243,He sucketh! God the man is a robot! I mean seriously how can one learn from someone who likes to teach in a lecture style and has the world's ultimate monotone!!! Argh.
4299,"Has difficulty focusing the class. Work is very unproductive, but time consuming. Too opinionated in her teaching. Looks down on students as inferior."
4356,WOW tries to be nice but only is to her favorite students. tries to teach but cannot convey her knowledge to students. obviously does not like her job.
4412,complete lack of knowledge concerning her field of teaching. No desire to teach or help others learn. Overall affect of making students hate english
4469,"She is fluent in spanish but lacks teaching strategies. Often puzzled as to what her unit objective is daily or what the assignment entails the student to do. Extremely easy class to succeed in though, more upside than downside."
4526,He goes off on tangents too much.He doesn't get half way through the lesson plan but I must admit he's humorous.
