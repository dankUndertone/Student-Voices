4691,She is a horrible teacher! If you have her transfer as soon as possible or you will be stuck learning on your own. Staying in her class requires tons of studying and sometimes even cheating.
4740,worst teacher ive had in my life. Very feminist which affects her teaching. I feel for those who have her in the future. Definately should be retired or fired.
4790,"Lynch was possibly the best teacher ive ever had, but this guy was possibly the worst. very nerdy, makes these terrible jokes about how indiana is better then penn state, way too many lectures, not very clear about what he is saying, tests are very difficult, has quizes every day, terrible teacher"
4840,Mrs. Jennings was a horribly principle! She never came out of her office. We never did anything fun and had boring assemblies. It was my worst year at welch by far.

5888,She was horrible. One of the worst teachers ever. She chooses favorites and if your not one of then you can kiss an A goodbye. I learned more about her life story than about English

6088,"She is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is rude, no sence of humor, gives all these bogus assignments, and just doesn't teach you a thing.

6188,"she is the WORST teacher ever. she is a mean, stuck up, and terrible woman. she has no heart and loves to make her students feel like crap. she is the worst!!"
6288,"She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had in all of my years in school. She has absolutely no enthusiasm at all whatsoever as to what she is teaching, and she does not teach at ALL. I rated the exam difficulty a 3 because her exams would be very easy IF SHE ACTUALLY TAUGHT WHAT WAS ON THEM. Every single day is just her writing things on the overhead with ridiculous far fetched analogies that are supposed to help you learn, but in reality just confuse you more, if that is even possible."

7086,"Mark Gallagher will forever be known as the teacher who ruined math for me, i used to be a great student and loved math, but then i joined his class, he doesnt know how to teach at all, GET OUT ALIVE!"
7186,"He's probably a better person than teacher. He has a monotone, and CBA is a waste of life. I had to fight to stay awake."

7785,"Terrible teacher. She should not be paid OR offered retirement. I have learned nothing, at all. She makes us use some sort of online learning tool called ""Emath Instruction"" which would be fine if we were taught anything. Terrible teacher, and I hope that I pass regents with her terrible teaching skills."
7884,I had him when I was in 6th grade. He is honestly a horrible teacher and I was forced to teach myself most of the math. Hopefully to any other students who have him currently will be smart enough to get help from someone else...
7984,He is seriously the one of the worst teaches that i have ever had. You will be so happy when he is no longer your teahcer! If you do not find him depressingly boring you have a serious problem.
8084,"Quite honestly one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She is very inconsistent on what she tells her classes. She will try to collect homework when she never even told the class about the assignment and if you disagree with her she will have none of it. If you happen to get her as a teacher, I feel VERY bad for you."
8184,"Hate just doesn't even begin to describe what I feel for ""Carol"". She is by far the WORST teacher you could possibly have. She gives notes and sits on the phone. Has absolutely no personality or sense of humor. Avoid her!"
8284,"very boring, unhelpful teacher here at ahs. i had some questions for him and he just disrespected them for no reason. too bad he teachs at our high school, he should retire."
8384,"I very much dislike Ms. Basten. Hands down, the worst teacher I've had in high school and probably will have at Wayzata. She doesn't a horrible job teaching lessons, she also asks if there are any questions, and I think people are scared to even ask. I tried to transferred out, but wasn't possible. When we review tests and quizzes, you have to come in before or after school if you have questions. In addition during lessons, you have to work with group members. She has the worst teaching style."
8483,Worst teacher ever! Does not teach and grades super hard... she really need a reality check and should consider her position as a teacher.
8583,"I had her for Art Intro and SP4 and I hardly ever saw her. If I didn't know who she was, I wouldn't have known she was our teacher."
8683,mr.monse sucks as a teacher. he sits in his office all day and doesn't teach us a thing and then wants to get mad and make us write essays all because he doesn't feel like teacher.he's super corny!
8783,Why she still here she's not a good teacher at all.. She showed us videos of nothing once like wth ms Rowe.. She should be fired
8883,This teacher is horrendous. The worst teacher I've had at Maine South. She does not belong in the science department at Maine South. Our science department is exceptional and Wagner just brings down the average. I've never had a worse teacher in my life. Except Ms. Zasky in middle school at Emerson. I am 100% serious when I say this. All those other posts about her jokes being funny are correct too. She also acts sort of nice in front of the class and then treats you terribly when you go to her
8982,"She is a horrible teacher. Although she knows what she's talking about in terms of photography, she does not know how to teacher children. She thinks that photography is m important as other classes."
9082,"O.K teacher, i mean she was nice but like all public school teachers she didnt know what she was talking about"
9182,"Terrible teacher. Kinda dumb and doesn't even know what she's teaching. Only gives good grades to ""select"" students and gives special treatment to those she likes. Needs to go back to teacher school."
9282,He is probably the worst teacher i have ever had. he explains literally nothing and everything that he says is useless information. he gets mad when we dont understand and is not helpful at all.
9382,He's probably the worst teacher I've ever had. He can be funny but he's really loud & not helpful at all. I had him for earths science but if you have him for a regents class BUY THE BARRONS!! He also doesn't really care about the students/ if they fail. Barely taught.
9481,"Lousy teacher, lousy coach, didn`t learn a thing, only liked a few runners and played favorites. Always assumed people were doing something bad, very judgemental and only had good teams when he had ab"
9581,"one of the worst teachers i have ever come in contact with. Has the IQ of a rock, picks on people and because of her, i'm not taking german next year. Thanks Frau Kau."
9681,one of the worst teaachers i have ever metother than sra. morris my spanish teacher thank god i had her last year and not this year also pretty hard
9781,"She is the absolute worst teacher on the Glendale High Campus. GHS is a great school with many great teacher with the exception of Sophia Kim. Also known to be MS. WOOOOOOO. Anyways she enjoys failing students, and given then no chance to receive a better grade. Ms. Woo failed my son last school year and because of this he can't get into a good college. 4 years of intense hard work and one teacher decided she wants to fail him. She need to be fired immediately."
9881,"This teacher has managed to teach barely anything all year and still keep her job. She has no sense of humor and seems like she barely knows what she's talking about. Not to mention her bias. She tries to enforce her liberal ideology in class, and favors anyone who shares her views. Bravo, Mrs. Parker. You've managed to make a terrible class even worse."
