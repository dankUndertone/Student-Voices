113,"Mr. Hoffman, your teaching methods were very ineffective and you didn't do a good job at teaching the class."
226,"she doesn't teach us, and doesn't give us clarity on our knowledge and topics in class."
339,She is nice but the requirements are not clear; her grading system is confusing and the learning materials are very primitive. She does not teach much but requires a lot.
452,She is extremly disorganized and easily distracted from what she is supposed to do to get paid. Teach. She doesn't care about the students or their grades atall
565,"This woman was the worst teacher I ever had. She knew less of the material than we did. She confused us by telling us the wrong information. She clearly does not enjoy ""teaching."""
678,She doesn't teach. She isn't very helpful and she doesn't have a challenging class.
792,"Style of teaching unimaginitive, bland, simply dictates, no teaching involved. Has her own ""way"" of doing things, so you can't teach yourself from the book."
905,"He needs to know the subject material better, so he can answer our questions instead of referrirng to the textbook."
1018,"Mrs. Burgess has a one-size-fits-all approach to art instruction, rather than letting students discover their creative selves. Students are expected to learn ""techniques"" and replicate them in projec"
1131,"strays greatly from proper teaching protocol, ineffective lessons. thank goodness that she's polite, though."
1244,"Mr. Ashley is a very frustrating teacher. He is never clear with his teaching, and mostly just has us do worksheets in class."
1357,jones enjoys informing his students of their lack of talent/potential because he played at carnegie hall and it was the pinnacle of his life. FAIL.
1470,"Feigenbaum- is a nice lady but an awful teacher. Her discussions go virtually nowhere, in fact, their almost completely content-less. Although she attempts at ""social programming"", it's ineffective."
1584,"Mr. Poley is an intelligent man, but he is just not equipped to teach high school students. I feel bad that his potential is wasted at Woodward."
1697,"The worst English teacher I've ever had. Very unorganized so we had to skip the most important book of the year, always picks on certain students, and seems to lack focus on her classroom activities."
1810,Mr. Archangel has very little knowledge of the subject matter that he teaches. He has lectured on subjects many times and has to be constantly corrected by the students. Additionally he consistently interjects not fact but rather opinion into world and national events but tries to pass them off as fact. He's typically prepared for class and often seems as if he's trying to figure out what we are supposed to be doing. Grading policies are never objective but very subjective. Bad...just bad.
1923,"essentially, he likes to say essentially alot and essentially doesnt teach very much.. i had him for 3 years"
2036,"Her class is very difficult. This would not be so bad if she was good at teaching. She doesn't answer questions clearly, contradicts herself constantly, and is condescending. Nice person though."
2149,horrible teacher and seemed over-consumed with attempting to assert her power. However much I hated her class (easily the worst class I have taken at lchs) she showed massive amounts of improvement
2263,"He's ok but his way of teaching isn't too good. He constantly uses sarcasm to teach and that causes there to be a lot of confusion, resulting in poor grades."
2376,Mr. Johnson cannot teach chemistry for his life! All he does is confuse me with his wacko methods. He is also very rude to certain students at times.
2489,"Mr. Mikula has greater than 70% of his students consistently failing his class. He does not provide any quality instruction. For example, his teaching method is primarily look in the textbook answer the questions, if you can't figure it out on your own...too bad for you. He takes no ownership of the results of his instruction. So much for accountability...huh? I hope they bring charter school funding so some kids like me can get good math instruction. He does not know or care about us."
2602,"very smart person but completely lacks the ability to actually teach. take her if you enjoy low grades on tests, teaching yourself, wasting a class period, and not being able to go in for help!"
2715,"She focuses on too much critiquing, and not actually getting hands on with the subject. wish i got garner"
2828,"My son had the unfortunate experience of being in Ms. Taffaro-Chica's class. She is a very unpleasant person to communicate with, and my son was exposed to very little new material in her class. Overall, this was a compete waste of time."
2941,I particuarly did not like ms. jackson because she was so unorganized and did not teach us very well. I am so glad she is leaving McMeans to teach at an elementary school!!!
3055,"I failed this class because she wouldn't show me how to export my final exam so I had to take a 0. She lacks review time, is untruthful, mean, and unintelligent. Her degree is in chemistry"
3168,Class is very easy! Minimal effort required to pass. She doesn't teach the material well enough for it to be any use to you in college.
3281,"No teaching involved. Either preschool work, or being ""inspired"" from her's. Always grades from her personal standards and not quality. Can't have ur own style"
3394,"He knew the material but failed to present it in an interesting way, and did not do well explaining it.. He was always disorganized and usually pretty moody."
3507,She can be very condescending and often gets lost in the middle of an explanation and gets students often lost. She does try to be very helpful but often confused students rather than helped them.
3620,"Oh gosh where do i start, first off she may have had all the good intentions in the world but that just doesn't make up for letting the talented students teach the entire course. She taught subject ma"
3733,"honestly and solely on the basis of his teaching ability, he is the worst. he was unhelpful in and outside of the classroom. he clearly spends more time crafting his dull wit than his lessons."
3847,does not know the subject matter at all! the only classroom she should be in is one where she is being taught the material by a PROFESSIONAL
3960,"The topics that we are covering seem easy, but she is making it 20 times harder!"
4073,Has her head up in the clouds. Very difficult to learn from. Very unclear. Often annoying. (But I suppose she is also a nice person.)
4186,"This man has absolutely no idea how to teach, much less in chemistry (which he apparently failed three times in college.) One of the more veteran teachers has to come in and teach him new concepts."
4299,"Has difficulty focusing the class. Work is very unproductive, but time consuming. Too opinionated in her teaching. Looks down on students as inferior."
4412,complete lack of knowledge concerning her field of teaching. No desire to teach or help others learn. Overall affect of making students hate english
4526,He goes off on tangents too much.He doesn't get half way through the lesson plan but I must admit he's humorous.
