83,Assigns a hard project that you have to complete on top of a mountain of homework IN ONE DAY!
167,"He is such a slow grader. He still hasn't graded essays from a month ago, even though he has had plenty of time over the numerous breaks."
251,"She is one of the worst teachers ever. She gives us a bunch of useless papers, and makes you do stuff and then never collects it. If you want to get a good grade add random color to everything."
335,"Hes so hard, all his work is muti projects. so its a bunch of little projects all combined together. Olny thing is the projects arent little."
418,"mrs. dawson is one of the most unclear teachers that i have ever had, the work is scetchy and the worksheets are pointless, THEY MAKE NO SENSE!!!"
502,You always change your mind about due dates for projects and papers at the last minute. Your class was very easy tho even though you gave me 4 or 5 zeros
586,Doesn't explain very well. Just gives a lot of work & homework on weekends. She does give extra credit work though.
670,Inconsistent w/instructions...gives last minute instructions on 9 wk projects when students have completed or nearly completed them...does not tell each class the same instructions...grades harshly & inconsistently
753,She gives us too much homework. She tells us two weeks before it is due and than she never tells us again.
837,she doesn't tell you things and then punishes you for not following the directions she never gave you. and she loses a lot of the paperwork...very strict...: /
921,Never gets the work back in a reasonable amount of time. Does she even grade the work when she first gets it?
1005,He is the worst. He revoked the grades that he had given me beforee multiple times. He also changed the grading system while we were taking a test. He said we wouldnt have finals but now he says we do hes the wrostarre
1088,"Not clear on assignments, disorganized and waits till last minute to enters grades, which she always messes up. Stay on top of her to make sure you get the grade you deserve. Also she puts material on tests that was never covered and expects you to know it."
1172,Lazy Teacher that gives little or no direction. Just gives out work sheets and sits are her desk and texts all day.
1256,He only likes his Publications class! Not clear on some assignments and don't give us enough time. Grades thinks wierdly. Ex: grades by how much you finish. He should just tell us to do something and give us a due date instead of cutting the assignment up into little pieces and grading it by little sections.
1340,she never hands back papers she is not only inconsitent but she is contradictory she does give extensions but rarely explains what should be doneHORRIBLE TEACHE
1423,Gives 6wks projects 1 wk before due. she requires a 6PG Report in less than 1 wk but we can only do it if we have the books we cant get take from the library.
1507,you were a very unorganized teacher you never checked the advanced classes homework but never seemed to forget to check anyother classes homework
1591,"i do not like this teacher,she always naggs and complains and doesn't check or give back homework,and gives unfair quizzes."
1675,"his tests r so hard. he has da worst policy of never changing a grade once you get it back, even if it is his fault.what is 3*4, but he took off 13 points"
1758,she is a horrible teacher i suggest u do ur homework she gives u homework every single dayy !!!!!! u will deffiently want ms binder for ur 7th grade math teacher ms binder is the bomb.com
1842,"Never updates skyward until after the trimester if at all. Just a lazy teacher who by the way, is as unathletic as ever."
1926,Very unorganized and can be unclear on directions. Does not know how to grade hw. Has a weird grading system and does not allow make ups on assignments. Transfer out if you get her
2010,She couldn't keep up with the assignments and the grades and didn't prepare us for our exam. I don't know what grade I ended up with in that class because she never updated edline.
2093,"I liked mr goodling as a person and when he taught us. What I didn't like about him is that he never followed through with any assignments and never graded anything, especially when we all worked really hard on it and he made a big deal out of the projects. He never even handed back our I-Search or Romeo and Juliet projects. Plus we read To Kill A Mockingbird for absolutely no reason other than to talk all the time. Most of his assignments are pointless and never graded."
2177,"Clearly overwhelmed by modern classroom requirements. Unable to keep up with online grades or assignments. Fails to grade student assignments by the end of grading periods and ignores them. If, as a parent, you ask about a grade, she'll tell you about how many pieces of paper she has to grade everyday. I get it, it is hard. By not grading assignments she earns an F just like a student would if they did not turn in an assignment. Abrupt with students, parents and administration."
2261,He doesnt make any sense.. Doesnt have a lesson plan.. His class is just a mess.. they do different things every day and gives homework that doesnt relate to the lesson.
2345,"shes kinda cool but she takes hw assignments as test grades. she was like ""if its not your best work dont turn it in"" to defend herself. i got a C on that ""test"""
2428,She is easy once you learn how she grades. She hardly ever gives tests but she grades tough on projects. Make sure you get good grades on the portfolios. Very unclear/
2512,"mrs lynn doesnt realize we have other periods and gives too much work, she yells at us when we ask a question and is almost impossible to work with"
2596,"Her class was difficult for me. She never taught us about writing, just handed out essay prompts and then handed them back with a score. We accomplished very little in the class."
2680,"Sporadically assigns unclear homework assignments, often contrary to those printed in her homework calendar. Yells at the entire class over trivial matters, which wastes time."
2763,I HATE Ms.Hoppie so much I can't stand her accent and she gives the dumbest work ever. I pay so much attention in her class i get 100's on all my tests and homework and she gives me a 90 for a quarter average. :P
2847,This woman is possibly the most insipid person I have met. Her homework is pointless. I have a hard time just getting through the instructions.
2931,"Really strict, makes sure you're totally organized. He goes off-topic a lot. Gives a lot of homework."
3015,unhelpful and forgetful. he is very slow on getting back to you if you ask him to investigate something. waits to update edline until you get a bad grade. save yourself and opt out of his class now!
3098,"if ur in algebra shes REALLY hard, homework everday and tests everyother week. if ur in math 8, u have homework once a week and rarely tests. very hard teacher!!"
3182,She sucks as a teacher she will give you a low grade for you work and tell you is wrong but she is so unclear
3266,does not explain subject well. Needs to be more detailed in what assignments she gives. Tell the students if their project is worth 55% of their grade!.
3350,Gives way to much homework at some times and none at other. NO balance at all. Though she is nice to talk to. Test are hard and some of the work is hard to understand.
3433,Ms. Goswami doesn't teach at ALL. She gives you worksheets at you do it the whole period. She collects your work at the end of class; but she may lose your work the next week.
3517,He gives to much homework waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
3601,"Mrs.Aliberto hasn't put a grade in for me in several weeks and the grading period is ending, so I have no clue what my grade is. Her assignments are confusing and useless and she always let's her students distract her, thus getting nothing done."
3685,All Mr. Mansour does is pick favorites and gives pointless assignments with almost always no due dates on any of them. Definitley one of my least favorite classes.
3768,Why is there no option for a lot of homework? This lady gives toooooo much work.
3852,Unorganized. Loses papers. Insane! Will go on rampages. Get him talking about something else and you won't have homework.
3936,"Always loses your work, and when you continue to give in copies she ignores them then at the end of the quarter puts in all F's for everything she's too lazy to grade always drooling on her computer."
4020,"Teacher makes own impression instead of class work. Even you can do very well on exam, classwork, homework. He will give you grade according his own rule. He makes participation more than everything else. Even you participate more than others, he will only make his own, not by fact."
4103,"She totally makes up all her lessons, and never collects the random busywork she gives us. NOT at ALL a good teacher."
4187,"Very hard to understand her, she will give labs and not go over them and tell you what to do in them. To be honest I think she is kind of lazy"
4271,"She doesnt teach, she just is cranky. She needs grades so she gives us bookwork and tells us to write long papers without telling us what it means. I mean we had to do a worksheet on GoodBurger."
4355,she is not too bright... she has had people doing home work in her class and she doeswnt realize it... people can even show her the same home work every single day and she will give you the points
4439,"He doesn't help anyone. He doesn't help with the work that he gives you. When he checks homework, he says ""Excellente"" and then gives you a 70! How is that good"
4522,Mitchell is ok...she can sometimes give meaningless work. She gives a lot of projects but overall she is pretty nice and she soes move back work if you ask her to.
4606,"She assigns way too much homework, most of the time its random busy work that does not relate to anything we learn in class. I wish she would stop treating her students as is we were infants. We do have some common sense, we did make it to Oxford!! One of the most annoying things about her is that she assigns different homework assignments for different periods. She is a confusing teacher who assigns so much homework that she even cant keep up with it. She could be less strict about late work!!"
4690,"I don't like her. First week of school and we have a massive essay that we're expected to have done over the weekend, and know how to do citations perfectly. I hate her."
4774,"Ms Murphy has taken weeks off, and when she comes back to school, she assigns a quiz or test on curriculum we haven't even heard about yet. On top of that, she has a tendency to give plenty of zeros on homework, and yell it kids a lot."
4857,"My biggest complaint about this teacher is that his teaching style and grading scale do not go well together at all. He grades things based off of a 4 point scale but uses these extremely skewed grading rubrics he pulls off the internet for his assessments. These assessments are 90% of his class meaning no one puts any effort into what he has to say unless its another test, so most of the class period is him talking to himself about an assignment no one will do. He should teach with his own work"
4941,Ashley can be mean and rarely is nice. Depending on her mood she gives a lot of homework or a little homework. She has no tolerance for anyone.
5025,Really sorry doesn't make things cleart and just assign us homework and then doesnt properly go over it then assign test and expects us to know it!!!!!
5109,"Mrs Snow is an awful teacher! she has too many favorites, and also has a few certain people she hates. She is unclear and never checks homework - she's so irresponsible!"
5192,Mrs. Randle never teaches anything and expects you to know everything. She delays all projects until the last six weeks and doesn't tell you how to do them.
5276,You are so mean and u will give us so much homework and i don't like the way you always give us textbook homework like every single day!
5360,You send me to bic every week and all your assignments bore me to tears.You assign way too much homework! WE GO TO SCHOOL FOR 7 HOURS 5 DAYS A WEEK AND THEN HAVE TO GO HOME AND DO MORE WORK! Its like u dont think we have a life after school.
5444,She confuses herself in class and will get mad at you for proving her wrong. I would not recommend taking her class your grade is based on a group paper and whatever she feels like that day.
5527,It was hard to care about this class. I have no idea how he graded us because we never got any scores on projects or anything back. He is disorganized so definitely don't expect a progress report.
5611,"I took AP US History and it was very clear that he graded with bias. He consistently gave me low essay grades even though I usually score pretty high in english/history classes. He gave some of my friends higher essay grades even though I usually get higher grades than them. I ultimately got a 4 on the AP exam while the people he graded higher got 2s. He read off slides the entire class, which was incredibly dull and the only reason I did well on the AP exam was crash course."
5695,She is very nice. I always feel like I understand what she tells us. However- she doesn't even mention about 75% of what will be on her tests. She gives enough fluff grades that the class isn't too too hard though.
5779,Completely biased. Gives out arbitrary grades on assignments with no standards. Discriminates against one class in favor of the other. So glad I graduated and don't see him anymore.
5862,Can you say bussy work? OMG she asigned more homework projects a week than most teachers do in a year. I cant believe she still gets paid.
5946,Very intelligent however she cannot relay her the information to her students successfully. Also is extremely forgetful. She forget to give me needed homework when I reminded her 4-5 times
6030,Assigns lots of busy work assignments. Here grading expectations are too high for high school students. Is not very understanding of the student's needs or extra curricular activities. She makes the class very hard to enjoy coming to.
6114,It is impossible to get higher than a C+ in his class. I guess the reason why is because I don't throw back his own opinions on his own test. Is this the point of Theology?
6197,You know how teachers give you busy work? He gives it to you and then doesn't grade it. You basically get an A in that class for showing up.
6281,Taking Comp Civics was a big mistake. My other grades are ruined thanks to his unreasonable expectations.
6365,"Smart guy but awful teacher, didnt even grade my sophomore research paper which we worked on for 3 months"
6449,"If you are a guy in her class she will hate you. If you put even slightly gender-biased language in papers such as ""mankind,"" instead of ""human-kind"" you will receive an automatic letter-grade drop."
6532,Teaches nothing. Hard to understand. You don't learn you get more confused. Your better off signing up for khan academy and learning from them instead. Gives you notice of a quiz the day its given. Gives packets and puts grades in extremely late so your grade stays low if you got one bad grade. Worst Teacher Ever.
6616,i dont like her at all. she doesn't teach anything in class and gives us way too many useless sheets of paper
6700,one of the hardest essay graders I have ever met. Her vocab tests and quizzes are impossible. The work load is an okay amount and she iis nice to you if she likes you...
6784,"At first glance, Coach Robertson makes you think he will be diffcult. As the year progresses you realize how easy it is to manipulate him. His tests are never clear and his projects have no point."
6867,"Mark Maretzki may not give out homework very often, but his grading is biased and although he is somewhat lenient on lateness, he does not understand how to handle students. he is repetitive and annoying. he should use some of the system's way of grading;"
6951,"If you ever get this teacher, switch out of her class IMMEDIATLY. very disorganized. Whenever there is a project, she barely gives out any information about it and no one knows what to do. For labs, she explains everything on the begining very quickly and then makes everyone do it on their own. No one knows what to do because she doesn't go through class assignments with us. Her grading system is terrible. You could do all the work and send it to her, and sometimes she won't receive the homework"
7035,"Lots of useless homework and boring labs. Claims teaching style is based on scientific research, but doubt it. One of the worst teachers I've ever had."
7119,"Very vague in her teaching and uses a condescending attitude if you did not hear a question, or did not understand what she is saying. She gives work back extremely late and gives lots of work but is unorganized. Can be pretty mean"
7202,"Focuses only on translations and barely teaches anything. Gives loads of hard pop quizzes on the most obscure things. Refuses to ever scale, and blames us for doing bad. Ha! No way."
7286,Really mean really short and doesn't even follow the rules she makes plus she gives us way too much homework
7370,"He is pretty much clueless when it comes to calculus, does unnecessary work, gives tests when he hasn't been in school for half the week and messes up almost every problem he attempts to do on the board. Very bad teacher."
7454,"Ms. Murphy assigns more homework, ""practice"" than is needed. It is lazy busy work on her part. She assigns ""practice"" (homework"" and then posts it online late. So, the kids go to do their homework and it is not there for hours. She is NEGATIVE & berates the students constantly for doing things wrong but does not explain the homework and consistently posts it late. My son who loves school and learning is miserable and now hates school & everyday with Ms. Murphy is a bad day"
7537,"This woman is very disorganized and spacy. I feel bad for her, since no one respects her, but then she brings it on herself. she lost my 200 point paper (and 3 other peoples')"
7621,She grades moderately but helps us with nothing. Our homework has nothing to do with what she teaches and still grades it. That is not fair!!!!!
7705,Mrs. Dawson is a teacher who says she assigns hw but she really desn't. its like she lies about hw. she gives way to many detentions for no good reason. in my opinion she should be let go. -Period 2
7789,I wasted 6 months in her class... She doesn't teach anything and gives a huge amount of homework without any support.
7872,he not organized. hard to understand. i have hw calendar from beginning of the school year that he have never collect. I personally think that he should stick with his other job that pays him 100k .
7956,he just uses the book like this other person here says and makes us take notes. whats the point? he even gave me no credit once cause i didnt put the heading on hw. i even did all the work! i hate him
8040,she gives TOO MUCH HOMEWORK she needs to help us more with our research paperss and explain everything to us
8124,"He is like super dooper boring and teaches straight from the book. Also he never gives us a chance to work together and help each other out, that's mess up!"
8207,She is very strict. She gives way too much homework and repeats the same topics over and over. Her classes are way behind and she expects us to know most of the topics already.
8291,"Very displeased with her attitude towards her student. I had a 90 percent a day before record day and it so happened to change to a 89 percent. When asked about it, she replied to my mother correcting her that I did not go down a point but a percentage.Also when we asked why my grade went down she answered with, that is just how the grade book focus works."
8375,"I've had Mrs. Blind for two different electives and it was, quite frankly, terrible. I had numerous issues with ""lost"" assignments or tests that took weeks to grade. Most of the assignments we were given were illogical or ineffective - as is her teaching style."
8375,"I've had Mrs. Blind for two different electives and it was, quite frankly, terrible. I had numerous issues with ""lost"" assignments or tests that took weeks to grade. Most of the assignments we were given were illogical or ineffective - as is her teaching style."
8543,She is very unclear(telling you the guidelines the day you turn something in)To succeed you mustread the textbook thouroughly on your own.Not enough room here to warn you of it all
8710,Mrs. Priwer never takes the time to discuss what we're reading and has some sort of unknown expectations for her essays. I don't think we read a good variety of literature either.
8878,"HE CANT TEACH n he'll take off as many points as he can, like if your lines arent straight on a graph. he never grades in time, and makes up excuses. i hate him"
9045,"Ms. Bambarger is, overall, one of the worst teachers I've ever had. She often just assigns reading from a packet and doesn't teach a lesson on the topic only to quiz you on the information over a month later. On top of this she is unclear and never answers a question if you ask her instead just dances around the answer. She also can never justify your score on projects often saying that she just ""felt"" that was what you deserved not following her very vague rubric she gave you at the start."
9213,She didn't answer my questions except in questions. Her grading also made it difficult to get a good grade.
9380,"she is ridiculous. she gives so much busy work for an AP Psychology class, she bombards us with all kinds of work, and doesn't seem to realize that she's not our only teacher"
9548,"This teacher has a hard time remembering to tell kids when something is assigned and almost never grades papers when it is due. I turned in an assigment, on time, two months ago and she still hasn't graded it! She is unhelpful and hates me for no reason. The classes are super boring and in the end, almost every kid ends up falling asleep, on the phone, talking, or eating. She yells at kids who aren't doing anything wrong and has no respect to the kids in the class and assigns too much homework."
9715,"Flores cannot teach well at all. His notes are written very badly and are hard to understand. He can be unreasonable if you forgot to get any homework assignment stamped, and puts information that we havent even learned on tests. He has favorites too."
9883,"she is hard... my parents aren't that happy with her even though they don't say anything about it. she doesn't count homework but she will lower it if you don't do it, your entire grade is based on your test, and her tests are deadly, you'll always end up with these BIG numbers or No Solution after like ten minites of solving. you should be happy with a D in her class 2.5/10 teacher"
10050,Omg his classes are boring and he gives to much homework and am failing cause he doesnt grade anything
10218,she gives this weird worksheet that you have to do at home and we barly play a sport by the time shes finished teaching us wht we allready know the school year is over
10385,I don't like Mrs.Meigs at all! She sets due dates and never collects the work.She also plays favriotes with people. she has good intentions but i don't like her...AT ALL!
10553,She got off task a lot and she enjoyed bossing everyone around. She wasn't very organized. ) : But she gave a lot of extra credit.
10720,"He's nice at grading, but he's not a good teacher. For some reason, no matter how much i try to pay attention, i always fall asleep x_X; Dont expect a high grade on regents."
10888,"Seems like a nice person, but her jokes are strange and she doesnt make anything clear, which makes it difficult to follow the class. She never gives any credit for homework which I think is unfair. Her speaking test grading is ridiculously harsh compared to the other spanish teachers at GHS, almost impossible to get a 20/20."
11055,She's like way too opinionated. She graded me down on some essays just because I didn't agree with her!
11223,"If she likes you, you're good to go, if she hates you, bad grades. Most of the stuff on the test isnt anything she ""teaches"", not even on the ""study guides"" She looses papers A LOT. I had last year, if ""you didnt turn it in"" you have to redo a paper about 3-7 times... Had her last year, nightmare!"
11390,"Really bad teacher, looses your homework and test corrections. Really paranoid and psychotic about students talking in class and such. Times you when u go to bathroom. Weird."
11558,"Mrs. May is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is unorganized, unprepared, honestly she's a mess. Mrs. May dosen't clarify or answer questions well, or really at all. She makes jokes and then yells 5 minutes later. She had screwed up my average a few times, and she never collects home work. She will mark you for no home work when she never collected it. I would suggest you switch out of her class, it has been hell and not even half way done with the year!"
11725,Never have I hated English more in my life than in her class.. You would think that if she gives you challenging tests and assignments she would atleast give you some preparation but Nope she doesn't guide you a bit and in return she'll grade your work like you are the child of her enemy
11893,"klein is a nice guy but could go back to school for a year or two. all we do in class is book work, and if its not book work its us teaching eachother."
12060,"The teacher was lazy and just copied and pasted generic responses that did not go with my work. For Example if i turned something in late its poor grade was reflected but then under it was written, ""great job turning your assignment on time and continue your excellant work., ...etc etc. The online classroom was not set up correctly and a few areas said things like,,,""talk about students assignments here.."" Different areas of the classroom also listed different assignments."
12228,She was not very clear with when papers were due she would say they were due the next day and you would have them done then she would say next week. She wasted a lot of time just talking about stuff not important. Her study guides for tests would never ask questions that helped with the test.
12395,"Lots of us in Ms. C's class believed that Ms. C played favorites. Also, Ms. C gives a lot projects, which makes it easy to get an A but doesn't help in English"
12563,I'm not exactly sure who is giving her all these good ratings. Ms Dulko takes powerpoints from the internet and tries to lecture on them. She has no idea what she is talking about and has awful grading policies. This woman puts absolutely no effort into teaching and never gives anything back.
12730,"Mr.Vogel thinks that his assignments are ""fun"" but they are just annoying and confusing and on top of all our other works it was just a waste of time!"
12898,"I had her for regents chem. She is smart, but cannot teach at all. Just really bad with kids. Terrible at communicating. High tendency to lose assignments for kids, and then will blame them for not turning it in."
13065,Worst teacher I have ever had. Cannot learn anything in her class! She tests over things she has never gone over with us. Will hold work until its late then put it in skyward with less points. Very weird and strict with students.
13233,she needs to stop talking for one two stop giving us work on work on work and three kids like to talk in class its what kids do
13400,"The classroom is so desolate and the teacher so unpleasant that you lose motivation. You will learn at the cost of extreme boredom and hatred. Nitpicks minor mistakes making tests easy to flunk.Scoffs when you have an error in your work.Daily homework +30 minutesKeeps obvious favoritesCan't admit when she makes a mistake, therefore there will be nothing you can do when she makes a grading errorThis class will lower your GPAYOU DO NOT NEED A STRICT, BORING CLASS IN ORDER TO LEARN"
13568,arg! way way too much hw... its all busy work... it doesnt help at all... he doesnt help at all. nice guy tho
13735,mr. thompson is completely unfair. we do get to go outside but he plays faves and gives whatever grade he wants. he's pretty nice but isn't clear in his teachings and is sometimes irresponsible.
13903,She is a great teacher until you mess up once. Then she ruins your grade in the class and tells you you are rude and disrespectful. She has made me hate my favorite subject.
14070,This teacher expects everyone who leaves her class to become better humans. She does not believe in grades and will not give you your grades back on test and other assignments. She expects the students to believe that grades are not important and colleges will understand that. Homework consisted of reading 15 to 30 pages of a book a night followed by questions. There are pop assessments that will test your ability to remember most of details that happened throughout the book. Discussion styled
14238,He is so caught up in physics that he doesn't even realize that no one understands what he's talking about. Mr. Felczan assigns way to many labs that students can't keep up. Most of class time is spent in labs and the day after we are given one lab he will assign another.
14405,"Mrs. Fernandez gives no homework to her students and we sing a lot, but I do not recommend her as a teacher. She is quite confusing for example she said, ""You guys can take your choir folders home, but they have to be here everyday."" What does that even mean? Mrs. Fernandez has us do ridiculous warm-ups and we barely sung this past month (mainly because we've being working on Singing Valentines, but still). She also does not manage time very well I wish Lawson would fire Mrs. Fernandez!!!!!!!!!!"
14573,"I had her in sixth grade, and she's actually the worst teacher I've ever had. For some ungodly reason, she would not give textbooks to students and would give out obscene amounts of homework to 11-year-olds. Because I had no book, I had to do a web crawl every night to find out how the planet's alignments worked and it literally took two hours. It was like an AP Bio class, not a sixth grade science class. She is also mean, and I'm very mild-mannered."
14740,"I am torn. I like Carl, but this schedule disagrred with me at times: Copy list/schedule, discuss something at Carl's leasure. Busywork. Good grades?"
14908,"Moody and clearly unused to teaching a classroom class (AP Art History). Be prepared to do all your work at home while she reads out of the textbook during class. We have done nothing but tests and powerpoints almost the whole time, and she loses our assignments constantly and gets cranky when we ask to see our grades so we never find out until report cards come."
15075,"Mrs. P is not a great teacher. Her classroom ethics involve favoritism and picking on kids who she does not really like, whether they deserve it or not. Her grading is very silly, as we have to go above and beyond what she asks us to get a decent grade on an assignment, and that is usually not enough (her favorites get A's, the rest do not...). She thinks her class is a college class, but she assigns and grades our projects based on creativity, rather then content."
15243,"Expect nothing but endless busy work and projects. Projects that you aren't given enough time to do and are explained extremely poorly. During time we could be asking questions about said projects, she decides to pile on more and more busy work. You won't learn a single thing the entire course. If you can, SWITCH OUT OF HER CLASS. I can't emphasize that enough. Horrible, biased, rude, and honestly pretty unintelligent. There's not much I can say that has not been said already. Please FIRE HER."
15410,"Mr. Labonne's way of analyzing the readings in class is a bit objective; I wish that there were open-ended discussions. Hw should be explained more precisely, & late hw should be accepted, esp. if caused by misunderstanding."
15578,"Ms Tisdale is the worst history teacher at IND! She was always late to class if we had her the first class of the day! Went way off topic during class. Never posted homework or grades on edline. Does not teach well because when it comes time for the test, you have no idea what any of the answers are. It is a teach yourself class!!"
15745,"I took this class because I really wanted to learn.The atmosphere is too loose. Everything is disorganized, and we never got to building models. Disappointing!"

16080,Ms.Caskey omg dont even get me started she is the worst teacher there is to be she never helps me and if she does she gives me this attitude and she never makes anything fun she gives us an hour of work and then crams in a 2 minute lesson that I can't even pay attention to because I'm finishing my work another thing Is we just started a book like 5 days ago and she expects us to on page 188 what do u think we r this is the technology century not the book and skating type
16248,"worst teacher, doesnt explain things, gives attitude, gives projects that no one understands, picks favorites, needs to learn how to be a teacher and mature"
16415,"Class is HARD. She teaches twice a week. Monday and Friday are days dedicated to quizzes. Friday is our ""reading day"" and she also takes a day off to be lazy Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Awful, awful class. She doesn't even have a good personality, just and ego because she's a doctor. YOU ARE A TEACHER HUN"
16583,"Mrs. Buote is, frankly, the worst teacher I have ever had. She literally taught our class nothing about art, yet clearly favored the students who were already good at it without her instruction. She also actually had the nerve to draw over student's work without even telling them what she was going to do. The homework assignments had nothing to do with the class assignment and she barely ever told us what they were, anyway. Honestly, her art is decent enough, but clearly not so good that she can do anything"
