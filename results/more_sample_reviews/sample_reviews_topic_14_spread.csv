301,"can't coach worth a penny, doesn't recognize talent even if ronaldo was kicking him...poor work ethic, not qualified,not helpful, not funny, aliens don't exist!"
351,He is too afraid of what other thinks so he is unwilling to make a decision that might go out on a limb and make the school better because someone somewhere might object

451,"""I can do 100 push ups in 3 minutes and bench press 200 pounds"" Boi, no you can not."
501,A fairly hypocritical principal. She yelled at us for getting up to throw trash away and then yelled at us for not throwing trash away.
551,He doesn't let us bring backpacks into the room and he doesn't move his neck or eyes. He is very stric and his teaching style is odd.
602,She isn't the brighest teacher you have ever seen considering she lock herself out of her house/car in 10 degree weather. She isn't the best teacher ither.

802,Ms. Wren has no idea what she is doing! Our school deserves to have a better (or at least more intelligent) principle. She threatened me and should be fired.

953,He is destroying the school.Many of its best teachers have left because of his decisions. If he doesn't leave soon I'm afraid that their won't be a school left to save.
1003,"If I'm right, one time, someone in my wing jumped out the window, ran around the school, and came back in through the door and she didn't know... or so I heard from a LOT of people..."
1053,Mrs. Fas is a GREAT teacher!!!...when theres a 53.65589574% chance of rain on a dark camel living under a gigantic smiley face.

1153,"he does no work, he lets reagan take care of everything. he just chases around people like ryan around all day."

1906,Is unclear with things and makes decisions for other people. I mean seriously can I get a wine glass at prom????
1956,As a parent I have to agree that Mr. Pellegrino is one of the worst adminstrators I have ever met. The Berea City Schools need to do some major house cleaning if they ever hope to pass another levy.
2006,"Should have quit after sustaining massive head injuries. Horrible coach and teacher, but very nice guy. Poor role model"
2056,"EGO, EGO, EGO,Does this guy have anything else to show us? How about some quality time with students?"

2558,he is horrible... ive seen him make people cry because he is so mean. i dont know why they brought his hairy self back to lane. hope he gets fired again.
2608,How did she buck union seniority? There are so many other better-qualified teachers who are stuck in worse New Haven schools.
2659,Overall she just is not a good prinicpal. She tries to put rules in place that really do not matter and needs to get more involved instead of thinking she has things under control from her office.
2709,"Hey kids, if this is the same Kevin Haney that taught at St Joes in Hammonton then look out. We loved him as a teacher and then he went online and talked behind everybody's back. He mocked the kids who loved him and said they were puppets eating out of his hand. He shamed students for being overweight or having acne. He seems cool but he is as fake as they get. Don't trust him."
2759,The guy should retire to play golf since thats all he cares about. I got an A in his class but I butted heads with him all year! I give him a BIG BOOOOO!!
2809,"I wish she retired, she's so lazy and doesn't teach music at all. To her she's just making herself look good."
2859,"Nice guy, if you tell him what he wants to hear. Extra points if you ""confide"" in him or suggest he's ""inspirational,"" as in Dead Poets Society or History Boys."
2909,"If you're looking to be in the best marching band in town,then Mr. Kelley's your guy. But if a solid music education with clear, consistent parent notification is what you want..go to another school!"
2960,"Bill is a baseball coach who masquerades as an Algebra teacher. Fortunately, some of us see through his clever disguise. Bill seems out of his element in class."
3010,"He is never in his office and when you need to talk to him, he sends you to somebody else. The only people he's nice to are the athletes of the school."
3060,Could we please play sports in gym class? i would have really enjoyed some good old fashioned games of dodgeball or basketball.
3110,Mrs.Bacon rules the school. She is soo nice but sometimes she can be strict and all she does is turn on a telekast and has us watch it. She doesn't even teach.
3160,"shes so annoying and mean and locks everyone's locks backwards. Like honestly, if you leave your lock open and someone steals you stuff then that is your punishment. its not necessary."
3210,"we arent going to be ""super duper quiet"" so dont ask. putting our heads down on our desks isnt very good punishment either"

3311,"Well, she's a nice person and all...but when Japan is on the ""caribbean"" plate.....(of which there is none)...you gotta wonder...."
3361,I couldn't stand Mrs.Handel. One of the reasons I took French was b/c I didn't want to risk getting her!!!
3411,I think Andy Fenoy of the Buckley School is the most useless teacher in the entire school. If someone would please fire him it being doing me a big favor. The amount of crap that he gives me is immense.
3461,"yells a lot, called me a spoiled brat, very disrespectful, doesnt get that school comes before after school activities, swore at our entire class"
3511,"I ENJOY SOCCER, AND IT'S MY HOBBY... HER HOBBY IS YELLING AND SCREAMING!!! OMG!! BUY A 100 PACK EARPLUGS,KEEP EM IN YOUR LOCKER!!!!"
3562,Very inapropriate with students. Had an incident involving police with a student. Be careful. Has been put on watch.
3612,Pretty much a waste of tax money - ! She never moved from her seat in the cafeteria! She didn't keep the halls clear or the noise down
3662,"heard this was her last year teaching, must say could care less about her now that i read the newspapers. parents will not stand for her to teach,"
3712,"i hate this man, he destroyed our band program. He sits there and ridules and is dead weight to the students work. And you wonder why everyone quits band???"
3762,"will somebody please do something about her? she reads to us for 40 minutes strait it is a free for all people do what they want, no teaching ever goes on. im not a good student but want more"
3812,Her class is pretty easy but rally doesn't teach. She allows us to do whatever at times. Too involved in her sports and brings her sports into class.
3863,"An incredibly sweet woman who really didn't have a clue about what was happening. Every time she left to make copies of assignments, the populars and their followers would have a look-out guard the door and proceed to jump on her computer and change their grades. People would cheat with their books open on their desk and she wouldn't notice, but she's catch the kids who had papers hidden under their shoes. She was in over her head. A nice lady but she can't teach or control teenagers."
3913,"doesnt teach, always yells, and only supports the best of the best players, chasing away those who need actual help."

4013,I think Chuck is unfair in his coaching practices. He loves to intimidate his players as opposed to gaining their respect through his coaching techniques. He also loves to brag about what he owns.
4063,no fortitude to stand up to the teacher union and do the right thing. Hypocritical in speech and actions.
4113,okay.ms.hoover is really mean.when you fail a run during luch she makes you run again around the gym..then you still have to make it up...and she forces us to do the bean run...i mean its our choice.
4164,"doc is biased towards his 'favorites' and if he doesnt like you, WATCH OUT !!! you will never get anywhere if you are on his bad side."
4214,If you want to hate everything about high school this is the guy for you. Every year tends to get just a little bit worse. You should hope its true hes leaving in 2009
4264,"smiling through your teeth and telling someone possibly the worst news they could hear that day, is not a positive teaching talent."
4314,Rood displays favoritism and now nepotism with selecting team players.Recently a number of good players have transferred to Clear Lake to avoid his unfair coaching technique.Why are there no seniors on the team? He makes the entire school year about baseball and the other sports suffer with fall leagues and winter practices.The players don't have fun it's more like a career and all about Rood and his record.In the past he over pitched pitchers to the point they had nothing left.
4364,She hates me so much that its not even fun having gym anymore. i personally love gym but she just wrecks it
4414,He gave me a detention between study hall and room 210 (the room right across the hall) for not having a hall pass. That says it all. He gives preferential treatment.
4465,knows nothing about teaching. looks like gollum and a turtle. limps around campus. her ankles are vainey and bloated.
4515,"She is a very interesting women. She is super mean to kids!!!!!!!!!!! but then super nice to the parents!!!!!!! One day went in for a bandage since my cut was bleeding.

4665,Way too much enthusiasim. Record-player persona. Not helpful on assignments. Traditional to the point of insanity.
4715,MR.witt has been are gym teacher for a long time he use to be better but as this grade hit he is not COOOL
4766,often strict? OFTEN STRICT? you've gotta be kidding me. Be afraid. Be very afraid. She spares no one. Cough during morning meeting and OFF WITH YOUR HEAD
4816,"You have got to be joking, she ""expelled"" me (ie, denied my special assignment) because I walked into an office. The woman is clueless."
4866,"New principal. Good on paper, not in practice. Iron Fist! Contrived PR spin master, grandstanding on the backs students, used as propaganda tools on her Twitter feed. ALL of these kids are SUPER, but theres no Professor X type leadership. Simply put, uninspiring and indifferent."
4916,I take the bus home from school and i was waiting for the second bus with other kids and it never come and everytime i asked her what was goin on she sid wait!
4966,god bless whoever else gets him because you are in for some real trouble he sits there hands out a lab and doesnt want you to talk to him..........EVERYDAY!

5217,"While i was in her class, i was in hell!!! The mastery quizes were pointless. Please, stop talkin to ur self in the hallway, it really is scary."
5318,FOOTBALL! FOOTBALL! FOOTBALL! that's all he cares about. No real assigned work or teaching in his class......basically a BS class to get a good grade.
5418,"She likes to yell at you if you don't participate, talk, laugh, or sit. She doesn't explain whats going to be on her tests, and comes up with the dumbest games. There was this game were we throw a soccer ball at a volleyball pole to make points. And she is a try hard at basketball."

5719,I hate your braces. 50 year olds shouldnt be mountain biking and flipping over handle bars! Its not right! And who cares about partacipial phrases???
5819,"A very poor coach. Does not treat athletes with respect and fairness. His runners are constantly injured from being overtrained and in three years of going to CIF, the team can never make it past prelims because they have already peaked and are exhausted from the overtraining. Has been in violation of CIF code of ethics before as well but nothing was done about it."

6321,i dont think that we should be the ones to keep track of our grades last time i checked it was the teachers job
6421,She expects so much out of us. she gives us so many assignments that are impossible to complete and it's ridiculous. she's really flaky and always late.she also cannot handle money very well at all. where does all of our money go? i swear she uses it on herself because i don't see where our money is going. and she has cancelled MANY band trips that we've paid for and do we get the money back? nope!
6522,She is the most favoritist woman you will ever have as a teacher. She makes you do pointless busy work that doesn't make sense or teaches. Please do yourself a favor and do not take her.
6622,"He's in-training to be the assistant principle, so he's almost like the ""detention king"" right now, but other than that, he's all right."

7224,"In high school, we called her ""Waldo"" because we never saw or heard from her. At graduation, someone shouted to ask, ""Who are you?"" Poor principal. What students used to call ""school spirit,"" she called ""unprofessional."" I wouldn't be surprised if she kicked in with uniforms. Good luck."
7324,"She isn't the greatest teacher at RJH, but she isn't as bad as MR. Davis. She talks about her children too much...Lay it down, Ms. Davis."
7425,I had Mrs. Lawrence last year. Best teacher I ever had. Her class was so much fun. We put gum on her phone and she bought a new one. Then we put milk behind her microwave and it stayed there all year.
7525,"If she says ""on tommorrow"" one more time...and oh....we know she's the principal because she brings it up...randomly. the choice is yours...!"

8930,Linda is a terrible trainer she has her favorites. If Parkwood doesnt watch out they are gonna find themselves in some deep trouble. WATCH
9030,"he never helps us and is always very rude. he walks around the school like he owns it and constantly says that the principal can't control what happens in his classroom. if I could rate negative numbers I would. he tells us that we ruin earth and we don't learn anything. he has more dropouts than the rest of the school combined because they can't handle his lack of teaching.overall, 1 star is very charitable"
9130,"He called me black once, so my nickname for the rest of the year was black. He signed my yearbook, ""Dear black, I respect your behave"""
9231,"Dr. Heard is a dance and health teacher. She hates all students in her classroom at all times. Her classes are boring, and the students learn nothing. She acts very knowledgeable, but is not. She makes us write essays that she never reads, and Dr. Heard dances out her feelings."
9331,all of the tests are off quizlet easiest A ever cannot say i learned anything though and got a 1 on the ap exam so did most about everyone in the class........ he thinks his jokes are funny and is naive about most of what happens in his class or realizes and doesn't car whatsoever a girls quilt went off in a test he simply looked up then went back to eating his apple. he is a really nice guy hough just teaching shouldn't be his field.... if u want to distract him bring up. marietta basketball
9431,"Honestly, Mr.Timko has to be the worst teacher at Mott. He plays favorites with anyone who plays sports, gets off topic and talks about his band and his footbals days, and trys to act cool. To make matters worse, he bangs a wooden stick on students desks for five minutes if no one answers his questions. Whoever hired him made the biggest mistake ever."
9532,"Not a good teacher, doesnt explain. Very moody, extremely rude. Better play football if you want to be on his good side. I reccomend switching to ms Dean if possible. Lang is a joke"
9632,"She's stuck up, and every day gives the impression that she thinks shes better then the rest of the school. She knows english and shakespeare perfectly, but conveys her knowledge without grace."
9732,"every day before i walk into his classroom i find myself needing to take a deep, meditative breath as to not eventually start swinging at someone (possibly Mr. Bauer) all that ever occurs in this class is sitting down and being bellowed at by our dear Kraigy ""LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! EXCUSE ME!"" at this point we all cringe and feel fear in its rawest form. after this we take notes, likely falling asleep and then my lord and savior John Green saves the day with crash course. highly recommend"
9833,"WORST TEACHER EVER. He takes time off of school to play video games. It's the 5th week of school and WE'RE STILL ON SAFETY!! I wish I could switch classes but if I did, I'd be too far behind. Also, he just talks and talks and talks (one kid fell asleep) and when he gets really deep into his talking I think he forgets that we're 8th graders, because last week he literally told us how to throw stuff in the trash. He doesn't assign a lot of homework, but when he does he piles on a LOT."
9933,"Her class was super easy, but she didn't talk any spanish. When the water pipe in L hallway broke she sat there and looked up the characters of Willy Wonka instead of helping students with questions."
