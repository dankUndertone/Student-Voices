5289,Very scatter-brained and gets off topic ALL the time. We get nothing done in her class. She's a really bad health teacher...

Mr. Jones is earnest and potentially annoying but nice. He's not a great teacher but he's trying ok"
9715,shes an ok teacher but she never came to class and when she wasn't here (like 75% of the time tbh lol) she would just assign a video and notes. Like yea it was really chill and easy but we were behind like 5 units and she would blame us for being behind even though all of her classes were behind. We didnt get to do all the fun labs everyone else did and on the eoc there were some questions that I've never even heard of before...She's kinda nice though but she gets mad at people pretty easily

He also has the most monotone voice I've ever heard personally I think it's rude to sleep in class but I managed to fall asleep in his..
10471,"Not a good teacher. Shows up late everyday, uses the book test so its stuff he doesn't go over, occasionally has us help grade his papers for him, usually 30 minutes of class are spent with our heads on our desks, very boring to listen, gets sidetracked super easily, and I don't think he knows exactly what he is teaching."
10579,u are the greatest u r a teacher that makes coming to school accually fun we need to be able to have cokes everyday
10687,"Although she is incredibly caring towards her students, she has also done very bad things while not teaching. In addition, we do barely anything in class but, we have so much HW on a daily basis. Honestly she is really funny as a person, but as a teacher she lacks organization and understanding. When writing essays she makes us 3 quotes per paragraph, it is more of someone elses words than your own. If you have her, you'll survive and might even have a good time, but pack your patience."
