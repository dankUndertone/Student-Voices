167,"He is such a slow grader. He still hasn't graded essays from a month ago, even though he has had plenty of time over the numerous breaks."
335,"Hes so hard, all his work is muti projects. so its a bunch of little projects all combined together. Olny thing is the projects arent little."
502,You always change your mind about due dates for projects and papers at the last minute. Your class was very easy tho even though you gave me 4 or 5 zeros
670,Inconsistent w/instructions...gives last minute instructions on 9 wk projects when students have completed or nearly completed them...does not tell each class the same instructions...grades harshly & inconsistently
837,she doesn't tell you things and then punishes you for not following the directions she never gave you. and she loses a lot of the paperwork...very strict...: /
1005,He is the worst. He revoked the grades that he had given me beforee multiple times. He also changed the grading system while we were taking a test. He said we wouldnt have finals but now he says we do hes the wrostarre
1172,Lazy Teacher that gives little or no direction. Just gives out work sheets and sits are her desk and texts all day.
1340,she never hands back papers she is not only inconsitent but she is contradictory she does give extensions but rarely explains what should be doneHORRIBLE TEACHE
1507,you were a very unorganized teacher you never checked the advanced classes homework but never seemed to forget to check anyother classes homework
1675,"his tests r so hard. he has da worst policy of never changing a grade once you get it back, even if it is his fault.what is 3*4, but he took off 13 points"
1842,"Never updates skyward until after the trimester if at all. Just a lazy teacher who by the way, is as unathletic as ever."
2010,She couldn't keep up with the assignments and the grades and didn't prepare us for our exam. I don't know what grade I ended up with in that class because she never updated edline.
2177,"Clearly overwhelmed by modern classroom requirements. Unable to keep up with online grades or assignments. Fails to grade student assignments by the end of grading periods and ignores them. If, as a parent, you ask about a grade, she'll tell you about how many pieces of paper she has to grade everyday. I get it, it is hard. By not grading assignments she earns an F just like a student would if they did not turn in an assignment. Abrupt with students, parents and administration."
2345,"shes kinda cool but she takes hw assignments as test grades. she was like ""if its not your best work dont turn it in"" to defend herself. i got a C on that ""test"""
2512,"mrs lynn doesnt realize we have other periods and gives too much work, she yells at us when we ask a question and is almost impossible to work with"
2680,"Sporadically assigns unclear homework assignments, often contrary to those printed in her homework calendar. Yells at the entire class over trivial matters, which wastes time."
2847,This woman is possibly the most insipid person I have met. Her homework is pointless. I have a hard time just getting through the instructions.
3015,unhelpful and forgetful. he is very slow on getting back to you if you ask him to investigate something. waits to update edline until you get a bad grade. save yourself and opt out of his class now!
3182,She sucks as a teacher she will give you a low grade for you work and tell you is wrong but she is so unclear
3350,Gives way to much homework at some times and none at other. NO balance at all. Though she is nice to talk to. Test are hard and some of the work is hard to understand.
3517,He gives to much homework waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
3685,All Mr. Mansour does is pick favorites and gives pointless assignments with almost always no due dates on any of them. Definitley one of my least favorite classes.
3852,Unorganized. Loses papers. Insane! Will go on rampages. Get him talking about something else and you won't have homework.
4020,"Teacher makes own impression instead of class work. Even you can do very well on exam, classwork, homework. He will give you grade according his own rule. He makes participation more than everything else. Even you participate more than others, he will only make his own, not by fact."
4187,"Very hard to understand her, she will give labs and not go over them and tell you what to do in them. To be honest I think she is kind of lazy"
4355,she is not too bright... she has had people doing home work in her class and she doeswnt realize it... people can even show her the same home work every single day and she will give you the points
4522,Mitchell is ok...she can sometimes give meaningless work. She gives a lot of projects but overall she is pretty nice and she soes move back work if you ask her to.
4690,"I don't like her. First week of school and we have a massive essay that we're expected to have done over the weekend, and know how to do citations perfectly. I hate her."
4857,"My biggest complaint about this teacher is that his teaching style and grading scale do not go well together at all. He grades things based off of a 4 point scale but uses these extremely skewed grading rubrics he pulls off the internet for his assessments. These assessments are 90% of his class meaning no one puts any effort into what he has to say unless its another test, so most of the class period is him talking to himself about an assignment no one will do. He should teach with his own work"
5025,Really sorry doesn't make things cleart and just assign us homework and then doesnt properly go over it then assign test and expects us to know it!!!!!
5192,Mrs. Randle never teaches anything and expects you to know everything. She delays all projects until the last six weeks and doesn't tell you how to do them.
5360,You send me to bic every week and all your assignments bore me to tears.You assign way too much homework! WE GO TO SCHOOL FOR 7 HOURS 5 DAYS A WEEK AND THEN HAVE TO GO HOME AND DO MORE WORK! Its like u dont think we have a life after school.
5527,It was hard to care about this class. I have no idea how he graded us because we never got any scores on projects or anything back. He is disorganized so definitely don't expect a progress report.
5695,She is very nice. I always feel like I understand what she tells us. However- she doesn't even mention about 75% of what will be on her tests. She gives enough fluff grades that the class isn't too too hard though.
5862,Can you say bussy work? OMG she asigned more homework projects a week than most teachers do in a year. I cant believe she still gets paid.
6030,Assigns lots of busy work assignments. Here grading expectations are too high for high school students. Is not very understanding of the student's needs or extra curricular activities. She makes the class very hard to enjoy coming to.
6197,You know how teachers give you busy work? He gives it to you and then doesn't grade it. You basically get an A in that class for showing up.
6365,"Smart guy but awful teacher, didnt even grade my sophomore research paper which we worked on for 3 months"
6532,Teaches nothing. Hard to understand. You don't learn you get more confused. Your better off signing up for khan academy and learning from them instead. Gives you notice of a quiz the day its given. Gives packets and puts grades in extremely late so your grade stays low if you got one bad grade. Worst Teacher Ever.
6700,one of the hardest essay graders I have ever met. Her vocab tests and quizzes are impossible. The work load is an okay amount and she iis nice to you if she likes you...
