173,"She tries, but doesn't make the class as interesting as the other teachers do. Also, she seems to enjoy making you feel dumb."
231,scariest teacher i ever had- made me scared to raise my hand. He made fun of kids. YAWW DAVIS go to angermanegment
288,"I agree, this teacher would treat us like babies and never helped anyone. Kindergarten is where she belongs."

404,"The way she treats Pre Ib students is ridiculous!! We are not in second grade! Treat us like adults! She also does not seem like a very nice teacher, I wish she would just loosen up."
462,she is mean and tries her hardest to make her students feel bad about themselves. She made me feel so stupid I wanted to cry.
519,Everything about her is scarey. How she smiles even though you get into trouble. She is really hard and doesn't seem to care what we have out of class. really needs to lightn up on homework
577,"didnt like her, moody, makes up things right on the spot, and was late to class every morning... happy she is gone"

1039,"Pick favorites, always has an attitude and you are the rudiest teacher ever. So who should put forth more effort?"
1097,he always leaves the class to talk to other teachers during a test and during class...we always fool around...wata fool
1155,I have a really hard to talk to Mrs.Moody. I just feel like she is judging me when I try to talk to her. I don't feel like I can talk to her... Sorry.
1212,Seems sort of whiney and like she doesn't want to be here and seems like she does work very long hours and kinda just does minimum.
1270,he sound like he teachers kindergarten or somethin...so weird so imature and seems like he has nothing in his brain
1328,"Poletto is the most boring teacher I've ever had, but it's a fun class, seeing how everyone argues with her constantly and for people to cheat on tests, even when she's looking"
1386,"He just wants to be everybody's friend, so kids don't respect him much. I did not learn much."
1444,"the man seems like he's only happy (smiling)when he's yelling at someone, also dosen't like to answer perfectly legitimate questions"
1501,"She is the worst! She is a control freak in some ways and doesn't take control where she needs to! She is only nice to the students she likes. And hey, how about a smile once in a while?"
1559,Always puts people on the spot like what there is so much homework there is no time for anything else just stop the random calling
1617,"Mrs. Faszewski is a bad teacher. All she did was put me down. I was an athlete and I always tried hard in her class, yet she never respected me. She'll only like you if your are physically challenged."
1675,Way to many presentations in his class. Liked to make dumb jokes while making of his own students. Always looks very tired...LAZY
1732,"Mr Dyal enjoys making my child and others feel very unappreciative. These kids need to feel apart of something, not yelled at."
1790,Her classroom is crazy. She is truly a great person and she loves everyone and she cares about everyone but sometimes it doesn't feel like she does.
1848,"Worst teacher ever. Hates students. Has ridiculously high expectations of sophomore work, yet treats 15-year-olds like 5 year olds... also flips out if you're wearing scented lotion."
1906,"the only reason people like her is that she'll let you talk in class all day and you don't have to do any work. and she'll let you skip from another class into her class.
not a very teacher-like attitude.
always late to fourth period class.
i'll admit she is usually nice. but SO LAZY."
1963,"She treats the class like 5-year-olds, and is surprised when they act like it. She seems like a nice person, but not an excellent teacher. Unclear explanations--i'm always confused"
2021,"she, like the rest of the guidance department, made me feel like I wasn't smart enough to get into college."
2079,"If a kid does something ridiculously stupid, like pull out cigarettes on campus, he doesn't come down hard enough, but for things like using phones in the call after ABCD lunch, he gave detentions. ??"
2137,I hate her and she's too immature acting like shes still in high school forgetting that she all ready grauated and is not a student anymore!!!!

2541,she likes to scream alot when nobody is doing anything at all!!!! if she doesnt hate you your going to get a 100.
2599,"i find her to be a bit annoying. last time i checked, making friends with the mischievous kids and mistreating those who actually behave is a bit out of place"

2714,"He needs to freaking throw the bad kids out if class like he says he will every day but never does, and be nice and call on the good kids for ONCE!"

3061,shes so phony. She all smiley and talks to you sometimes and than ignores you when she is in a bad mood
3119,he is a teacher he feels like he has to prove something by arguing and giving detentions. He is the type of teacher he worrys more about how kids respect him and act then what they actually learn

3523,im surprised she still has kids in the class..no one likes her...no one likes the class...she doesnt make it fun at all..she yells alot...horrible
3581,"She always looks over my shoulder to see if I'm paying attention. It gets really annoying, because it makes me uncomfortable. If I know the subject, then I'm drawing! So what if I don't pay attention, I don't like math! In general! But her as a person, she's pretty nice."
3638,the only reason we dont like her is beacuse she is mean to everyone for no reason... kids are just sticking up for themselves and it makes us look like we're bad.
3696,He has no idea what life is like for students these days and all he does is take away all the rights we have and make high school even more miserable. He is uptight and not open to any sort of fun.
3754,Ms. Lindvall really knows her speech. What she lacks is the ability to relate to students. It is almost like she enjoys seeing kids fail.

4100,"Hated this class. It wasn't hard, but Mrs. she herself ruined it. It's not that she's strict/mean- she's that, she's fake, and she makes you feel horrid about yourself and afraid to ask questions."
4158,"She doesn' even use a textbook which makes it hard to keep up. I hate her class and she doesn't care about any of her students. Not to mention our UCP class is above the Honors, and she is way top tryhard. Don't reccomend her, I feel you if you get her :("
4216,always make mistakes and obviously has favorites She has crazy mood swings and always yells at everyone
4274,"One of the worst teachers I ever had, didn't like me from the first day, and she really doesn't think students should play sports and school at the same time. HORIBBLE!!!!!!!!!!!"

4505,She treats all of her students differntly if she likes you than you are find but if you are a boy than no chance
4563,"She is not afraid to take control of the situation. Which is a bad thing. She makes it seem that she is in charge, even with the other teachers which are at same level in the heirarchy of school."
4620,"SWITZER is always acting like everything is fine and he has everything in control when it isn't, he has no good advice and does not own up to his word.
