2332,"she gets to class late, leaves for like a 30min in the middle of class. she gets calls on her cell in the middle of class. she doesent notice anything."
2392,"Instead of teaching the material in class he will spend most of the period going over homework while other people sleep. Then he will constantly attack you for not going to tutoring and/or missing homework. Very exasperating and dull, he just does not realize that what goes on in the classroom is just as, if not more, important then what goes on at home."
2451,"She clearly knows a lot about Chemistry, but since she spends most of her time talking about her family, personal life, or how students are lazy, not much ever gets across. Avoid if at all possible."
2511,"Her entire class is basically this, ""sit down, be quiet, type random gibberish"" She is not a mean teacher, but not a fun 1 either. i just didn't like her class"

2691,"His classes are horrible. Every period you sit and listen to him talk about NOTHING. If you're in it for the threate, switch to CATA. If you can't get into CATA, then hope he picks you as a favorite."
2750,She talks to her self constantly! Its so annoying.. she rips apart everything ne one says! Shes the WORST teacher ever!
2810,storys ar funny and hes a funny guy. but get off topic and take to much notes and half the time its not even on the tests!!!!! put stuff we learn on the test
2870,"He can be Funny at times! and Just annoying the next, he needs To be Clearer In talking and Should slow down. He needs to also go over Stuff more since its geometry!"
2930,You might not pass her class but you will have one heck of a year if your friends are in the same period.
2990,"Always talks about all the stuff he did at Los Alamos. Doesn't do much in class, mostly talks about himself, sometimes goes over homework problems, takes forever to grade stuff. Shouldn't teach AC."
3049,"has no respect for any students at all. seems as if she never has a clue what shes talking about, i correct her all the time. she is VERY full of herself."
3109,I like her as a person but cmon she does no know how to work with teens. I hear her 6 hour walks all over her
3169,"he yells at us for not doing what he said, even though he doesn't watch becasue hes always on his cell phone!"

3289,I hate the rule that we can't sleep in your class when its very very boring when we have to watch long documented videos. When the bell rings I jump with joy.

3408,MS. Arismendy is very mean she very strict and her teachings take up the whole class she only gives us like 15 minutes to work her class is pointless
3468,"Mr. Porter is a nerd.He can not spell, seriously he can't, he can not teach all he does is sit at the over head and talk about stuff no one cares about........."
3528,i switched classes after 2 weeks....doesnt teach at all...we ended up teaching our selves because she doesnt know what to do...also she tells lots of personal stories that no one wants to hear
3588,Probably the most pretentious person I've ever met. Spends more time talking about his vacation to Italy then anything else. Still very easy course work you could spit in his face everyday and still get a B-.
3647,"One of the worst teachers I ever had. All she did was talk, talk, talk, about how much she loves our class, then yells at us for asking questions. I'm glad this year is over!"
3707,"He was fun at times but, annoying and mean at others. IT was an easy class. He did not teach anyhting and he just told stories about his life."
3767,er.. hes rele weird. yeah. and no one likes him at all and he makes us do totally pointless things that dont relate to the unit.
3827,"Don't take his class if you take the subject seriously, because he doesn't. I had him for sociology, and yes he's funny but I didn't learn a thing. He talks about himself the whole time. Not good."
3887,"I honestly dont remember one thing we learned. She just talked about her social life the whole time. She was a very nice person to talk to and I liked her alot, but she only taught us things that she"
3946,"he is very ........ never mind. his tests are easy, he is generous, but he does spend too much time talking nonstop."
4006,i hate this guy he cant teach for the life of it and calls people out makes us feel like absolute garbage. spend more time teaching and less time talking about food and videogames
4066,i can't believe this woman is teaching kids. she is very emotional. She talks down to the kids and yells when they ask a question to be repeated
4126,"Not the greatest teacher. Talks about track, football, and goes way off topic to much so we dont get much done. Cool guy and pretty hilarious so class is at least entertaining but very unproductive."
4186,"i have to say, he didnt teach at all. all we did was read the book in class and do the homework. no structure, didnt know what he was talking about, not much help either."
4245,She's okay...annoying how she comes to school sick all the time then tells us not to come when we're sick...also gets off track easily. But Spanish 4 is easy.
4305,"he makes jokes, but i dont really think its funny i just go along with it(he says jokes over and over again)"
4365,"I'm taking History 1. Every day he writes the instructions on the board, so you can grab a worksheet. The thing is, he'll start talking, and he just. won't. stop. Says he's going to talk for 5 minutes, ends up doing 15 minutes. exaggerates unnecessarily on things like font size, font, and assignment value/length. You can take the assignment for the day and be done with it before he's done talking. Use the period for something actually important. Have fun tuning him out, he'll never stop."
4425,"This guy is hilarious! he doesn't try to be, but being in this class will give you some great moment."
4485,"This teacher is very strict and does not enjoy small talk. I once tried to say hello and all I got a death stare. She does not take socializing lightly and will keep a very silent class room. DO NOT get this teacher, AVOID!!!!!!!!!"
4544,"She's nice from time to time, but the woman has no idea how to run a classroom and she picks favorites. It's freaking annoying."
4604,Has no control over her class. Talks way too much about her kids and husband. Reading off a power point is not teaching.
4664,When she talks does her voice seem to droan on and on forever or is it just me? She wore the purple outfit today...if you have ever had her you know that one.
4724,"you're a great teacher and all, but all of us get tired of doing the same thing every single day, i think we need a free day every now and then, instead of work"
4784,"Mr. Large is the worst teacher ever! He talks in a voice no one can hear nor understand. He gives people detention for no reason. For example, while doing our work, he told the class we could talk. So, everyone was talking and he comes up to me and my friends tells us that we're talking talking about something science related and gave us a detain even though no one was talking about anything science related! If you get his class, I suggest you switch out of it...fast! Not one student likes him!"
4843,"I am sick of her telling me my opinions are wrong because she doesen't agree with them, also i ahte how she talks about other students when they are not around"
4903,I think she is a rude teacher. She likes to talk bad about you to your parents and she doesnt know what shes talking about. Her jokes aren't funny.
4963,He talks way to much. He could just explain stuff in to seconds instead he takes forever and yuo still dont understand it.
5023,"i cant believe anyone would give her a good rating, she doesn't know how to teach.. she spends all her time asking students about their love lives."
5083,the WORST teacher i have ever had. his lectures are so long and dull the entire class is asleep within the first ten minutes. tells inappropriate jokes. gives a ridiculous amount of busy-work.
5142,Gives no directions and does not explain things. Spends 99% of the time in a different room than the class.
5202,Not subject competant when it comes to Psych. Blatently doesn't know what she's talking about and dodges the questions. Wastes our time with pointless stuff.
5262,"I was standing next to my squad spot and he made me tardy, then we talked during the morning announcements and he made us run suicides!!!! On our CV day!!!!!!!"
5322,"He thinks that he's funny but he isn't and he mumbles too much in class. His hands are distracting and he doesn't help you at all if you go in for help, he just tells you to go back and reread the chapter or he just sits there and ignores you until you go up and say that you came in early in the morning for help and not just to sit in some math room with a weird teacher. He's nice but he just isn't meant to be a teacher. Useless guy overall"
5382,Oh my gosh! She is the worst teacher ever!! The most work is what we do for homework! There are times when we don't even get to go over the homework in class because she talks the whole time!
5441,He always gets confused its like he has no idea what hes talking abuot. And he hates anyone in his class who talks AT ALL. I hate this guy.
5501,He is very fun..sometimes.. but he doesn't really clearly explain his assignments. It is hard to keep up with his class because he talks fast and a little quiet so that the back rows couldn't hear him as much as the front. other that Mr. Paul is okay i guess. His stories eventually lead up to the topic of the day but he should really explain his readers and writers notebook more clearly.
5561,"She is the type that would come late to class by 10-15 minutes and even if she was there on time, she STILL wouldnt start class until a good 15 minutes have passed. She would rather down or neglect a"
5621,Half the time the teacher doesn't know what she is talking about.She is the most ignorant teacher I've had to listen to.Oh yeah aren't we in English not Histor!
5681,"Not the best teacher..... she wastes time by making us watch motivational youtube videos. She is not the best at tech stuff, barely knows how to work a computer let alone a smartboard."
5740,This dude is weird. He gives alot of homework and just tells us about his action packed fantastic four comic books.
5800,She TALKS TOO much! Blah blah blah! And then she never gives us papers back so we dont know if should study or take a break. She is ok but she goes on and on...
5860,she talks WAY to much!!!!! she travels a lot so whenever she is teaching us something shell break into another travel story...its SO annoying!!!!
5920,"I found him to be extremely annoying, but thats just me. I rarely understood what he was talking about...and that's if he was talking about the lesson..."
5980,"She gave half the class detention for whispering and then gave us useless hme wrk as always if u get her try to be as helpful as possible, and don't blurt out random things she won't think its funny."
5980,"She gave half the class detention for whispering and then gave us useless hme wrk as always if u get her try to be as helpful as possible, and don't blurt out random things she won't think its funny."
6099,"Blah, Blah, blah. he just babbles on and on and on. He tells students he'll give them great grades if there nice to him"
6219,He does really like to hear himself talk.What I don't like is watching movies all the time.I was hoping to learn something.
6338,"He is without a doubt the worst teacher I have ever had, and I know that's harsh, but it's true. All he does is sit at his desk on his computer all of class, and after an entire year in his class, I know zero physics."
6458,"nice teacher, if you're into theatre arts that is. he talks on and on about the most irrelevant thing for 30 minutes. he makes you write a one page journal everyday"
6578,"positive-extremely smart/negatives- all he does is lecture, goes to slow (takes him 20 min to get class started) we are 5+ chapters behind everyone else! BORING, not well rounded!"
6697,"No idea what's happened in between the time these reviews were written and the time I've had her, but she is among the worst teachers I've ever had. In 'helpfulness' and 'clarity', it genuinely upsets me that I have to give her a single star. Her personal life has gotten in the way of her teaching several times. Sometimes she gets up and leaves for no reason in the middle of the lesson. Has made J&C a huge disappointment for me."
6817,"She's an okay teacher, but she's way to nosy when it comes to your personal life and speaks way to much about her personal experience for an art class. If you need help, you're going to have to wait until she's spent 5 minutes 'getting ready' (staring at the computer/doing some menial task) and even then, she'll probably get distracted."
6936,"He's the worst language teacher i've ever had. he spends too much time telling stories. Don't take this class--wait for french in 10th, mrs marques is awesome!"
7056,"OMG!!!!!this class was soooooo boring! and i had to be her slave everyday! i had to get her stupid water all the time...im her student, not her slave"
7176,she acts nice but she doesn't care..goes right in one ear and out the other...and will call ur mom if you talk to the other gender..
7295,"She is very nice, but not that good for her subject.. I've had her for three years and I barely know anything. The spanish-speakers in my class say she has no idea what she is talking about."
7415,I also do homework in his class. Its like a free period. He has no idea what kids are doing in the back row
7534,"If you want to learn German culture and language this is the teacher to avoid, the class is a easy A if you're willing to listen to him tell his personal life and talk to friends for 1 hour."
7654,"he is the most annoying teacher EVER!!! he is a terrible lax coach, although it is funny to watch him try to coach. he is a MAJOR show-off."
7774,"barely uses the textbook, always says 'its not rocket science, oh wait it is!', knows material but literally can't teach it, half the class is behind and confused, he made me hate science"
7893,It would help if he actually showed up to school and not leave in the middle of class to get starbucks. Always on his phone. Lazy. doesn't teach anything new
8013,"Michael Torres is a textbook narcissist who practices blatant favoritism and tells the most long-winded, pointless stories that often take up entire class periods. Don't worry, if you miss one of these stories you'll probably hear it again next week. The only bigger joke than his ""teaching"" is his acting. I've sat through multiple plays that he appeared in and it was unbearable. Talk about chewing scenery."
8132,"Je n'aime pas Ms. Dan gives to many quizzes and is to tough, but she is caring and tells funny stories"
8252,i hate her class everyone is almost failing it she knows what she talks about but she does not have the ability to teach and keep us intrested. every class she puts half of us to sleep
8372,HE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WEIRD!!! he tells weird stories...ask him about the time he out ran a bear! He isn't a good teacher but he is funny...I guess.
8491,goes off on huge tangents. wastes so much time not knowing how to work projector. he gives the worst notes. our class is doing so much better w/ our student teacher now
8611,"ive never had such a a bad teacher , really nice person but hi grow up n stop lettin kids walk in and talk while ur attemptin to uhh not teach?! BIGGEST ->stop favoring"
8730,"Mrs. Coe is never around to talk to. She is always to busy or is leaving her office too early. Need to talk to a guidance counselor, don't count on Mrs. Coe."
8850,"Horrible. Wasted an entire year in her class. All she does if read directly from a website, and when asked for help, she stands behind you and goes, ""ummm..."" until she gets bored and leaves."
8970,"She never listens to me when I have a question, and i'm always having to teach myself. She sends us home with homework to teach ourselves the lesson and it's tiring teaching myself. I need a teacher. She doesn't even know the material half the time."
9089,"He yells constantly and doesn't mind that he is yelling at middle schoolers! It's not just once every six months or only a few times, no! It happens every day! He has yelled at my peers multiple times to 'Shut up' or even yelled at them directly in front of the whole class. Throws temper tantrums regularly when things don't go his way or if we get loud. In no way have any of my classes with him do I see necessary that he needs to yell."
9209,"He barely help us with anytrhing. He sometimes can be confusing. For class he would give you like a 30 minute lesson (maybe less), then leave us to be in the class room."
9328,one word. LOUD. you can hear from the other side of the school.. imagine sitting in the first row.. not fun. shes an okay teacher.. its easy falling asleep in her clssroom duringa movie
9448,"you moved everyone away from each other! yeah, we talked... alot. but can u blame us? your class is boring!"
9568,"She needs to stop telling students things like ""Never leave your children home alone with their dad."""
9687,Literally has zero control over her class. At the start of every class there is about 20 people that aren't even in the class and just come in and mess with her and the guys try and see how far they can push her. She constantly threaten to give people detentions and write them up but never does anything. People literally get up and leave in the middle of the lesson to take laps with their friends. She is the worst.
9807,She does not teach the students. When I come in for help she just sits on her phone and doesn't help. The worst teacher I have ever had.
9926,He'd talk to the sports ppl and when someone tried to read during his pointless conversations he'd yell at them. Good friend to the populars but bad teacher.
10046,"he has absolutely no control over his class, and so half the class sits there with their cellphones. he can explain things well but you have to be very specific when asking for help. he does not teach"
10166,"She has no idea what she's talking about, and is quite possibly the most condisending person I've ever met"
10285,I was a straight A student until I entered Ms. Duccomun's class. She doesn't explain anything at all. All she does is talk about her dog. Whenever i asked for clarification on a topic she would just repeat what she just said and it wouldnt help at all. Worst teacher at JJHS.
10405,all those who speak of Mardi Gra parties gettin ruined and Mucho Gracias will remeber that famous 04-05 French Class! so fricken easy and funny and yet stupid all at the same time
10524,Your teaching is the worst that Ive ever seen... answering the phone in the middle of class.. yellin at people just bc u feel like it.. u need to leave...
10644,joey ballgame is not a very good teacher. no one comes to his class and the school doesnt even give him a room to teach in. he just goes to classes with the students and blends in cuz hes negrey
10764,"Brucey B is a knowledgable teacher, yet his methods of teaching are terrible and repetitive. Every class, we start with a homework check, then we either do a chart on the black board, watch a terrible-quality VHS tape that makes half of the class fall alseep, or read articles and do expert groups. Most of the time its videos, and they always give me a headache. He also talks really slow with long gaps and should have retired last year. His lectures aren't bad, but they are way too long."
10883,Mr. L is a strange guy. He can be very forceful to people in my class with special needs. He talks a lot about judiasm and history. Not teacher material. all you have to do is be nice
11003,"probably one of the worst teachers i have ever had. he throws out detentions like confetti. he makes a big deal out of everything. all of the tests he gives out have nothing to do with what we learned in class. he spends most of his time on his computer and making rude and sarcastic remarks about the students in his class. he could be completely normal one minute and then yelling in the next. also, he keeps the classroom at about 50 degrees."
11122,"Picked on students & went off into random conversations about herself. I didn't learn very much & she likes to brag about ""how good a teacher she is"" when she doesn't teach us much"
11242,She give;s out a lot of homwork. And she lets students go off on rants like how their Mom watches docctor Phil. Real educational
11362,"Worst teacher in the whole school. Wastes time in class going over proofs that do not matter, and then spends only 10 minutes going over actual problems. Tests are full of questions that were never gone over in class. She has an extremely fake personality, dressing up only when a supervisor watches her class, and chooses to sit at her desk and text her chinese friends instead of actually teaching. if you are reading this liu, i hope you know you are a terrible teacher and should not teach"
11481,"I seriously think this guy could not pass his own class. He routinely gets tripped up by his own problems and will spend much time trying to solve them. In all brutal honesty, mr. p should not be in a classroom. His classroom environment has been wildly detrimental to my learning...he hasn't even done notes, and he goes on wild tangents on the white board to a point in which even the brightest kids in the class have no earthly idea what he's saying. Bad vibes...2"
11601,"She is an extremely disorganized and horrible teacher. Keep track of your own grades! If you laugh at her corny jokes, she will like you. I've seen her make very mean jokes to other students which I feel are very immature for a teacher."
11720,"He is a very interesting teacher, it was nice to recieve an easy A, but he continuously went off topic to talk about something that was not Italian, and he usually explained it in another language other than English or Italian. He was extremely nice and funny though and his stories were the reason I would have the drive to come to school in the morning. Highly reccomend Capaldo if your looking for a good laugh. Also he hates cell phones, they are ""evil"" so is any other form of technology."
11840,"She is the worst Spanish teacher ive ever had. If you want to hear someone taking...more like rambling for 30 at a time in Spanish, this is a great class for you to take. I'm in AP and have gotten worse in Spanish because of her and I'm practically fluent. She is an awful teacher. Her material is from 1984..no joke some of the articles we read date back that far."
