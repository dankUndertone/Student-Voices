49,When i graduated i was so happy!....no not because i was out of school but because i was out of her class.
98,well now that im in high school mrs ericcson messed up my whole year...in algerbra we didnt even get to the 2nd book putting me way behind in geomertry
147,My son came home upset after nearly every class because she would pick on him before anyone else.
196,He was so abnoxious! I got an A in the class but thats only because of Ms. B! She should be conducting NOT him! He never let us out of class on time!
245,Half way through the year she still didnt know my name. my average was a 27 and it was because she put all my grades under someone elses name since she didnt know mine. It was an awful year
294,mrs northrup is very unorganized she messed up my grade and my friends gave me a detention for being tardy when shes tardy in the morning and everyone waits outside her class room for 5-10min
343,i remembered when i was in 6th grade and i got into Arista and she told me that i didnt deserve it just because i didnt understand something in class. ugh i still remember that....
392,she is so negative. Every day we just enter the classroom and she starts yelling st us. I wish we had MRs. Hutteman.
441,"I did all the work and I didn't pass. Did not have grades, she passed only eight out of ten students. Started out with 25 and left with ten. Have to retake 096 but I have a different teacher and I am passing that class."
490,"She was pretty much awful the entire year. as soon as i left her math class i was extatic, and when i walked in her room one day i forgot everything. thanks to ms.emanuel i got a 600 o my math SOL"
539,You gave me my first F even though I worked real hard and it discouraged me the rest of the year. Now I am behind STILL in 9th. -.- I cant get caught up.
588,"SHE'S HARD, SHE'S A BAD TEACHER... AND EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO HER EVERY ADVISORY FOR HELP... I STILL FAILED THE CLASS..."
637,"We are the first class he has taught after 6 years. Let's just say that what he ""teaches"" does not stay in our minds for weeks to come."
686,"WAS GIVING MY GOOD GRADES TO ANOTHER STUDENT THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER. WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT IT,SHE GOT MAD AND SAID IT WAS MY FAULT,CUZ OF OUR ALIKE LAST NAME"
735,I had Mr.Piteris a couple years ago and he was one of the worst teachers I ever had he just gave us labs that we had to do in under a week and he was absent 3 out of the 5 days in the week that we had school and when he did show up he just sat at his computer and slept I had a failing average in his class until I got a tutor and he helped me raise my grade from a F to a C+ and when ever you asked him a question he just says to go to extra help and there he even just stares at his computer.THANKS
784,"I am a sophmore at SRHS now and i can finally get away from this guy. He subbed for about a month in 8th grade, and everyone in the class bombed the test. It almost kept me from getting to go on the ECT.PS: He has sweaty armpits"
833,I never even saw her at all until junior year. Completely uninvolved with the school and doesn't even make an effort to help students.
882,I hated her! I had her for homeroom and she wouldn't let us leave during STAR for anything not even the bathroom! She found out who my friends boy friend was and always bugged her about him!
931,"Had her last year (i'm in 6th grade) She never let us do our own work, we always had to do it her way"
980,got my schedule and it said hunter i was so happy until someone told me it was k hunter i wanted not j. argh.
1029,2 me u r sooo boring. but i had da best sleep in ur class. I am soo happy i transferred out of ur class after 3 days.
1078,the worst teacher i've ever had. she didnt even teach and i ended up having trouble in algebra 2 after i took this class
1127,Last year was a good class but coming into this year i expected so much more. You have changed as a teaher and your personality has changed a lot.
1176,"wow mr. Icavano it was so e-z to getout of class and out of school with you, thanks here's a hint i have been in your office every month in 05 to 06 year, yeah its me the _______ I was in Kestlingers"
1225,He got suspended....... and I'm learning more on the 1st day then i did throughout the whole year with him
1274,I missed a test cuzz I was out of town then he had all of these subs so I couldn't make up my test when he came back he said it was 2 late to make up the test!!
1323,"lots of time to do homework, i sure did. but people really fall asleep, and my friend never got a referall...in 6th grade! but this year, she gave my friend bucket duty for 2 weeks"
1372,"september 23rd, 20,000. the year was 20,000 for a whole week. we WATCHED her write it... oh and i skipped her class 19 times freshman year and got caught once. by the sub."
1422,"I have never met someone so unbelievably stupid. had her twice and never learned a thing. My friends and I copied each other's tests identically and we each got different grades. Not even close to similar. The one the slept every class got a 90, the one that actually knew what he was doing got an 80, and the two that worked their butts off but still didnt understand got a 60 and a 65...what?..."
1471,wow....what an interesting woman. she needs to retire...FAST. its was semester and she still didn't know people's names. she could never remembered what she taught us
1520,this guy hardly showed up for work my goodness come on i mean all we learned about is bach last time i saw him he was at fharrel
1569,we watched a movie the last day of school when all the other global language classes didnt have to come so we walked out and he wrote us up. thanks a lot pajor
1618,She doesn't even know whats goin on in her class. One boy got his head busted and she wasn't even there.
1667,WORST TEACHER EVER!I had 90s in math EVEry yEAr this year i fail midterm and he REFUSED to go over it then kicked me out into the hall when i asked why..if u get him GET OUT NOW!!!
1716,grr.... i dont like him... he doesnt help u and he also gave me bad grades. he gave me two b's on my report card.. i dont like him hes to strict
1765,"I had Ms. Bobeck last year and I didn't learn a thing. I failed the last four tests and still got an A in the class, ha what a great teacher! *rolls eyes*"
1814,"This teacher tought me in 7th grade @ home ec and she told us stuff her friends told her, not facts. I think she needs 2 go back 2 school 2 learn more."
1863,Chapman was horrible. i missed one hw and she called my parents and told them lies about me. she hated me and favored all the brainiacs in the class. no help
1912,"Dude, not a good vice principal. I remember he kept saying marcella's name wrong. I guess he was nice, as long as he wasn't yelling."
1961,Really confusing if you don't have friends in your class. Never knew what was going on for the first half of the year.
2010,He was awful. I had him last year. He started screaming at our class and another teacher had to come in and calm him down.
2059,I took 3 years of french in high school and my last year i had mr. teahan. I am now in french 101 in college and i still am having a hard time because i forgot everything thanks to this class. Horrible class.
2108,"He called us ""douchebags"" and ""assholes"". On the first day he told us ""Â…you're probably not brilliant if you're in this class."" He made a sixteen-year-old girl cry, and he made a girl in my class who had just moved from China and knew less than rudimentary English read complex scientific passages. It was his first year of teaching, so maybe he's changed, but this was my experience."
2157,"SWITCH OUT NOW. I asked for help every single time I needed it but was denied. Finally, when the whole class insisted, she was very unclear and difficult."
2206,I HATE!!! mrs.mcqueen she talked on and on and blamed kids for things we didnt even do! im so glad i dont have her anymore! she gives homework at the last week of the school!!she is awful!
2255,"She is an awful woman. My son comes home upset everyday, and he finally told me why. He said it was MS.backes. I didn't think it was anything big, so I left it alone. About a week later he called me and told me that she screamed at him, and that he had to file a BULLY REPORT on her. I talked to him and he didn't want me to email HER because he said she would send him to the principles office, like she did to another child. I talked to the school and they said they would talk to her, but..."
2304,she is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!! she made me come into her office 4 times because she forgot she already met with me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :(
2353,"This year she had eye surgery so everyones feeling bad for her when she comes in and all she does in complain again. I cant stand her anymore, if you get her instead of mayercheck in 7th, get switched"
2402,okay...well...she is OK but she talks with her teeth. she told my friend to stop nagging when she relly needed help with her math. :(
2451,i just have her for homeroom but she does unnessesary things like yelling at you three times even when you do nothing wrong
2500,"MR THAYER!!! I had mr. thayer in 7th grade, He taught my dad and my uncle, and my brother. So I guess hes been teaching for a while :) he was a great teacher."
2549,Thanks for the 52 on the lab mrs. copeland. Ill try to remeber the half-life of popcorn kernals next time
2598,Anybody that actually had her at one point knew what an unhelpful teacher she was. So glad I dont have her anymore.
2647,"Has never helped me, forgets my name, and doesn't teach. My spanish has gone downhill since he became my teacher. Thanks, Mr. Moreau"
2696,she only walks around doing nothing thats the whole thing yelling and screaming blah blah blah blah blah who cares anymore. Do your work do this yeah right!
2745,"Brannum was the hardest teacher i had over 4 yrs at TC, i took bio without honors and i still i rececived the lowest grade i ve had in all 4 yrs. for my 10th to 11th grade, i had all A s in everything. Everyone told me to switch to Fick and i thought everyone who said that just can't work hard enough, but i ended up with a low grade even though i tried."
2794,She talks way too much about her nails. We were trying to cheer one of my friend up because she was upset. Everything was going fine until... Mrs. Pugh came barging in. Made my friend her feel worse.
2844,"She has a bad personality. she is ok,now that it is the end of the year. But in the bigging. She never teaches anything she is not helpful. Now She is moving to 8 Grade I better not HAVE HER AGAIN."
2893,She is too harsh for a 2nd grade teacher. She made me flat out cry the only time I ever have to this day at school.
2942,I aced every assignment and test. I missed two hours of class. He gave me a B- because I wouldn't stay after my graduation four an extra four hours.
2991,ms. martinez is the worst teacher i've ever had. she yelled at me all the time for no reason at all and one time she even made me cry. i hated seventh grade because of her.
3040,I had the worst time in her class! She isn't leniant at all to anything even excused medical abcenses. If you begin to fall behind she has no way to recover notes and just recommends that you drop the class! I believe I would have understood algebra 2 better if I had a teacher willing to work with me from the start of the year.
3089,"I had Mr. Bella last year, he's hard, sometimes very unclear...but in the end, you do good...I mean I got a 90 on the regents, so at least he helped me there..."
3138,"She is sometimes good, and extremely easy. She doesn't grade that way though. I never got a 4. Also, the 8th Grade DVD. What a joke!!!!!!! You'll never recieve it. Sorry little kids!!!"
3187,"hey, you can get into the desks from both sides!!! yeah, that about summed up the calibur of that class. There was no teaching involved. You had better already know the stuff, or you'd fail. I got mad enough that I dropped it at the semester."
3236,One of the other teachers in the school told me not to listin to what Mrs. I said because she was probably wrong. I have to agree with the teacher who told me this. Sorry Mrs. I but your better at 3rd
3285,"HATE HER. I only have her for homeroom, and I think that she is out to get me. I was walking to history one day, and she yelled at two people who were rushing to class next to me, and told them they should be hurrying."
3334,You know that when 7 out of 11 students fail a class there is something wrong. The students ended up trying to teach each other becaus eshe was never there.
3383,He gave the class Es on a project because he thought we cheated. He is my least favorite teacher I have had.
3432,She is mean and at 1st she was allright but now we aren't even allowed to talk in advisory but she is only a sub but this could be permenent!:(
3481,"You call yourself a teacher, ha. I am going to be so screwed next year in geometry preap because you haven't taught us anything!!!"
3530,"she is the worst teacher i have ever had,because when my friend was talking, she told ME to be quiet, and then my friend confessed that she was the one talking, and camille barre told her that she didn't care. So i got in trouble."
3579,"interesting class to say the least.. I think I failed.. See, I dont even remember the class.. Oh well.. She is a wonderful person!"
3628,she gave tests very frequently on information that was scarcely taught in class and criticized us on homework that we had no clue on how to complete and frequently sent people out into the hall for no reason and when they didn't know what we learned in class they had to continuously go into the hall until they were so far behind that they were kept after school until they were caught up and then the cycle repeated
3677,"20 years ago, I almost didn't graduate because of this teacher. Luckily I aced my final and didn't have to spend another year with him."
3726,he gave everyone 100 extra bonus points on a test if they rode the bus. he gave someone detention for saying bye class when he was going to the bathroom. hes so annoying.
3775,"WORST teacher ive ever had. 6th grade LAL? Got A's and A 's. 7th grade with Ms. Schmidt? She told me I was writing 4th grade material and gave me c's and D's. Took a tutoring class over the summer from a professional writer, who told me that my writing was highschool level, even though i was only in 8th grade. Go to 8th grade with Ms. Schmidt? Says my work and everyone else's is garbage and gives me more C's and D's. SHE LOVES THE PASSAGES CLASS. Always gives them A's."
3824,you can get along with him if you are on the football team.he said I disrupted class even tho he & the jocks talked while I was doing my work.
3873,she'z nice but she waz absent alot....sumtymz she az mean....i can't even tell u wat da class sang wen she waz absent.....:-)..
3922,"he's super nice...but doesn't do his job well and messes up a lot of schedules. I got 2 messed up schedules from him, then met with Devries who easily fixed my problems and got it all worked out."
