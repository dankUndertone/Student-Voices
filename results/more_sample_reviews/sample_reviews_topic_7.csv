2272,ONE OF THE WORST TEACHERS I'VE EVER HAD. he was awful. he was on the computer or watching the news the whole time. didn't have control of his class at all. easy
2392,"Instead of teaching the material in class he will spend most of the period going over homework while other people sleep. Then he will constantly attack you for not going to tutoring and/or missing homework. Very exasperating and dull, he just does not realize that what goes on in the classroom is just as, if not more, important then what goes on at home."
2511,"Her entire class is basically this, ""sit down, be quiet, type random gibberish"" She is not a mean teacher, but not a fun 1 either. i just didn't like her class"

3229,when i saw her i struggled not to laugh u could do about anything in her class without her knowing. funny times!!!!!

3468,"Mr. Porter is a nerd.He can not spell, seriously he can't, he can not teach all he does is sit at the over head and talk about stuff no one cares about........."
3588,Probably the most pretentious person I've ever met. Spends more time talking about his vacation to Italy then anything else. Still very easy course work you could spit in his face everyday and still get a B-.
3707,"He was fun at times but, annoying and mean at others. IT was an easy class. He did not teach anyhting and he just told stories about his life."
3827,"Don't take his class if you take the subject seriously, because he doesn't. I had him for sociology, and yes he's funny but I didn't learn a thing. He talks about himself the whole time. Not good."
3946,"he is very ........ never mind. his tests are easy, he is generous, but he does spend too much time talking nonstop."
4066,i can't believe this woman is teaching kids. she is very emotional. She talks down to the kids and yells when they ask a question to be repeated
4186,"i have to say, he didnt teach at all. all we did was read the book in class and do the homework. no structure, didnt know what he was talking about, not much help either."

4544,"She's nice from time to time, but the woman has no idea how to run a classroom and she picks favorites. It's freaking annoying."
4664,When she talks does her voice seem to droan on and on forever or is it just me? She wore the purple outfit today...if you have ever had her you know that one.
4784,"Mr. Large is the worst teacher ever! He talks in a voice no one can hear nor understand. He gives people detention for no reason. For example, while doing our work, he told the class we could talk. So, everyone was talking and he comes up to me and my friends tells us that we're talking talking about something science related and gave us a detain even though no one was talking about anything science related! If you get his class, I suggest you switch out of it...fast! Not one student likes him!"
