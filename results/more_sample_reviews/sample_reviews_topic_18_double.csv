532,Mrs. Paris is mean and isn't helpful. all she does is pick a side( part 1 or part 2) then complain about it.

585,she does not talk to students. it is obvious that she likes some more than others and grades according to who she likes

1037,"She is not a very good teacher and plays extreme favorites on certain people. When choosing people for the play/musical she closes the ones that can help her the most ranging from who can provide money for it to who can build things for the set. She never actually chooses on real talent as seen in her last musical, she choose someone since their mom could provide the the theater department with funding. Overall I think she is unfair and in general a bad teacher. Would not recommend!"
1064,She totally chose favorites and hated anyone who deny agree with her or who wasn't in cheer

1357,Probably my least favorite teacher Sophomore year and definitely my least favorite history teacher ever.
1383,"Blair is the problem with our music program at LC. I had her for orchestra and she is the reason I stopped doing something I loved. Can't even compare her to Bart (sac teacher). I got worse, not better, throughout the year. Good at choir, bad at orchestra."
1410,In my experience Valdez is a teacher who clearly plays favorites with her students and even with certain instruments. She does not develop musical theory skills and spends most of her time getting off topic and telling stories.
1436,"He's probably the worst teacher I have ever had, he completely ruined me on music, and my passion for orchestra. He's verbally abusive, and has a cold heart."
1463,He is a horrible teacher and puts down his students. There is no way anyone could think is a good teacher. He should at least praise!

1596,"i dislike her sooo much! she plays favorites and makes the non-favorites cry, and when they're crying, she yells at them more!she does'nt belong in a classroom!"
1623,"Her peso system is frustrating. Basically you need 5 pesos for the vocal part of your test. The way to get these pesos is to participate. I'm fine with this idea but she executed this process in the worst way possible. She picks the same students over and over again and even if you do participate, you only have a 20% chance of getting a peso. I don't care about her singing, but letting only a select few students get called on for peso questions everyday is unfair and biased. Worst teacher so far"
1649,"loves to kick out like 7 of us and yell, can't play sorts and play bad grades o yeh CLASS AVERAGE A F cause she carsabout us playin even if everyoneparticipate"
1676,"He hates technology. And he plays favorites. The better he likes you the higher grade you'll get, if he doesn't like you then well good luck."
1703,"She has favorites, yells at people for no good reason and can't conduct. The songs she picks out for class are terrible, we do the same exact thing every day."
1729,Mrs. Sandoval runs the theater department based on favoritism. If you are not one of her favorites don't expect to get roles. Favorites are determined by being friends with prior favorites. This has led to a system of cliques and cattiness in the theater.People who get roles think they are superior to everyone and their talent is overpraised. If you are in a higher level theater class and don't get a part you won't learn anything. She is emotionally manipulative. Do Communit theater instead
1756,mr sutherland thinks hes the best teacher but all he does is tell stories about himself. he only pretends to take an interest in the kids and leaves out certian students. dont play favorites.
1782,"he is a good teacher but he is very sarcastic. he will put you down if he doesnt like what you did. in theatre he complains a lot.he favored his students, those who are in theatre and help out."
1809,"If you like to sing and perform do not take her class. The performances are lame that Elementary Schools have better performances. She gives you a music history paper to write because she needs to fill up time because there is no performances to work towards. She is confusing and not a very nice person. If you like to sing, then just do it on your own and join a church choir."
1836,"Ms. Najar is a terrible teacher! She is mean, and nasty, and horrible! She chooses favorites and they are mostly made up of the quiet ones!"
1862,"Heath is good only if she likes you and you are one of her top kids. If not you are left alone, and she is mean. plays favorites."

1915,The IB kids seem to like him but he talks down to and degrades the orchestra kids. He is also very unfair and makes bad song choices. He also has little to no respect for his two lower orchestras and
1942,"everyone sophomore will love vento for her wittiness and strong personality.Definitely whips you into shape when writing an essay and is very good at her job. Overall if you have the chance to take her class, go for it, but in my opinion there are downsides. She makes it very obvious that she has favorites, extremely obvious, and it is fact that she gives into highschool drama which is very innapropraite and frankly annoying, definitely not a favorite teacher due to her snootiness as well."
1969,"Ew definitely the worst muscal theatre teacher ever.She didnt care what we wanted to do for Broadway Bound, she just picked the worst show in theatre's history.She taught me nothing.I hate that woman!"
1995,"hate her... so obvious favorites... when she picks on you to answer, before you can answer, she says NO and picks someone else!!1"
2022,"Didn't try to know the students. Would pick song choices on his own, didn't take input to what we prefer. Fun class, but not necessarily because of him."
2048,"He thinks he's all that, but he's not. He likes to blame and pick on certain students b/c his bands do so bad. That's why he loses so many good players."
2075,"completely unfair and picks favorites. if you are not one of her favorites, she picks on and insults you. very very mean. if you do one thing wrong, she will scream at you and embarass you on purpose."
2102,very biased towards students... shows a lot of favoritism... can't teach if her life depends on it... BORING LIKE NONE OTHER!
2128,"depends on what you think is important, technique or musicality. if its musicality, you are out lof luck in this program. he chooses favorites and is hard to get along with."
