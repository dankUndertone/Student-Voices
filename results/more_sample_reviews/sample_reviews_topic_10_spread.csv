458,"The only way to not fail that class, is to not listen to what she says. Everytime i listen, i get confused. When i dont listen, i do fine and get A's."
509,"She avoided my questions, and kept going on and on about how she can't read our mind because nobody was going to ask her questions because she never answered them...."

And then I asked Mr. Beilin about the problem and he said that I was right and she was wrong. So basically, she seems to think she is always right, and she does not respect all her students."
866,"She is REALLY irritating and shows way too much favoritism. For example, if we are going over a multiple choice question as a class, she would choose the wrong answer choice and try to convince us it's right. When we start arguing with her she checks the question and it turns out SHE was wrong. Also, whenever you ask her a question she ALWAYS has to ask the other teachers and never gets back to you on it."

1274,"At times, ignores students. VERY UNCLEAR. Must ask questions numerous times to get a clear response. Yet very laid back."

If he is talking to a student, I'd wait, as time goes on, he completely ignores my presence that I'm there looking for help.

1732,"He said that if you do the homework, you would not have problem take test. that is not true"

2956,"Sergio is a miserable teacher. He gives unclear directions and homework, quizzes with things that we never learned and doesn't help. One time on a quiz for number 1, I got C for the correct answer and he marked it correctly. My partner also got C for 1 but he marked it wrong... Another time he marked a conjugation wrong that was right and I spent 10 minutes tying to figure out what was wrong, then I asked him and he said, ""Oh its fine.""

4485,"Mrs. Carlock is not a good teacher she ignores us a lot of times.She only likes the students who type fast.If you dont type fast she tell us to be like the ones who do and she uses us as a bad example. When I tell her to help she just says she will de right back in a miniute , and she never does."

P.S. she says 'fiddlesticks' wayyyyy too much"
4689,"Mrs. Vaidya can be somewhat rude and disrespectful, if you forget anything she'll definitely call you out for it. If you ask your classmate a question relevant to the class she'll stop the whole class and call you out. She doesn't seem to know when to stop a joke.

5046,She isn't very good at teaching and she will make fun of students and they say 'just kidding' as if it changes what she just said
5097,Mary Misiazek is very unclear when she is teaching. She makes a lot of mistakes on correcting tests and in class that the students have to correct her on she cannot even do simple addition.

5198,"What can I say about Mrs.Magonagle?Ummm... the most interesting thing i learned from her would be...ummm...hmmm...hold on,it'll come to me...oh yeah!wait,no,nvm"
5300,"The nerdiest teacher you can get in the whole school.When you ask him a logical question, he answers you in a way that makes you feel so stupid even though the question was smart. He makes us write so many notes and study stuff and then gives us a 1 day warning about a test."
5402,"Such a nice man but not a great teacher. I don't really think he knows physics that well because whenever we would go over our answers and explanations on the practice tests (which were the same thing as the actual test), he would tell us we were doing it right, but when we actually took the test, we would get an 80% because the answers he said were right were actually wrong :(...."
5504,"Let's just say there's a reason why she got boo'ed by half the school at pep assemblies... She's a horrible teacher and an even worse person! I always take an active role in trying to solve my own problems and take initiative in seeking help, but she actually punished asking for help and told me to read the book, which wasn't at all helpful because it was the book that had confused me! It's a sign of a poor teacher who doesn't know what they're teaching. I'd rather go through hell than have her."
5606,He pays no attention to your problems and says the most cornius things. He thinks that physics in cool when no one else does.
5708,I'll admit Gress is a nice guy but he really doesn't care about the students. I went to him several time for help with some matters and basically he just tells you that he'll help but never gets to it. Just a poor principal.
5810,"hes okay. but he always wastes our time during gym when we could be doing something fun. and if we even say one word during the warm ups, we have to start all over again. WE'RE JUST KIDS!!!"
5912,"he is the meanest teacher ever, and the worst trainer, for softball he completely ignored our team and everytime we needed something he would yell at us"
6014,It's only the 3rd day of school and I'm already completely lost. She only helps you if you ask specific questions. Speaks so fast that its like a different language! WISH ME LUCK!
6116,"he only knows o ne way to teach and if you ask him for help he refuses to give it, saying it is all in the book anyways. if you are in his class, all ima say is god luck, you'll need it."

6422,"On 9/11/2001, this lady refused to let us know what was going on. We had english class for an hour. I'll never forgive her......"
6524,"probably one of the worst teachers, doesn't thoroughly explain stuff or know how to communicate. his examples are the same from the book and his answer to every question is to look it up, and most of the time he has no idea how to do the problems himself. too bad he didnt retire before i got him."
6626,"she is rude and self obsessed. unclear with the material, so it makes it harder for us to learn. never says if we are right or wrong becaues she doesnt know"
6728,The only reason Franny is cool is because her class is never boring. There's always something to laugh at. Usualy its Franny yelling at someone.
6829,"This teacher does not agree with any advice that students give her, she always yells at them and gives conduct cuts if you DO give advice."
6931,"She's clueless. You learn almost nothing from her, she puts on videos and overhead slides and that's it. Have a question? The only answer I remember getting was ""Look in the book!"" She should be fired"
7033,"not helpful. rude. likes to yell. doesn't actually teach, but just solves the problems on the projector and make us copy the answers down. our class average for our last test was 44%. i feel verbally abused everytime im in that class. when i ask questions she is very vague with her answers and we rush through every chapter we are on, not retaining any of the information we learned from the day before."
7135,"I've learned more on sparknotes than I have in his class. He himself doesn't appear to knowledgeable and he even copies verbatim from said sources to use as ""his thoughts"" for class. This outright plagiarism is deplorable, and he never answers the questions I ask. He usually just replies ""well, what do you think?"" and leaves me wondering if he is even trying to help me."
7237,"""What was blowing in the boys' faces while they were walking up the mountain?"" This is one of the questions from a reading check quiz. Need I say more? The answer, BTW, is ashes."
7339,She doesn't know what she's doing and you can't understand anything she says. She does something different for every class she'll bump an 85 up to an A for some people and won't bump an 89 up for othe
7441,omg i hate her.. if you ever have her switch out.. im switching out tomorrow. she'll call u stupid if u dont understand something. shes the worst..
7543,She has more favoritism than any teacher I know. Whenever she's mad she brings negative energy to the classroom. Not that she's ever a positive person. She always talks about her sister in a bitter tone and tries to befriend students as if she's a student herself. Whenever I ask questions she gives me one worded answers and dismisses me before I can say anything else. I just read the textbook to pass her class.
7645,"the best advice I could ever give her is to go back to being a flight attendant, far from everyone else, and high in the sky...where she belongs! She always thinks she's right, and will ALWAYS value her own opinion above her own. SOOO BIASED!!!!!!!!!!!"
7747,"She is by far, the worst teacher at Paul VI, and that is saying something! She never responds to your email, even if you talk to her about the email in person. Your grade could quite literally change from a 94 to a 64 in a day without any notice. She is rude, confusing, and a whole litany of other negative words. I have not learned a thing since being in her class."
7849,"Never is fair in the classroom, gets mad when questions are asked, never answers questions, never gives enough time or make up time for tests and quizzes. She also uses a lot of attitude towards the kids which tends to make people to dislike you. Oh and unorganized."
7951,Mr. stowers is not very clear and does not give the impression that he knows what he is talking about. Often he would get his own practice problems wrong and not on pourpose. He is very nice but just doesnt know how to teach high schoolers.
8053,"She tells us to experiment with our writing, but then never tells us if what we're doing is good or not. I don't think she likes to teach."
8155,"His class was one that I will never forget for all the wrong reasons. His tests focused on the tiniest details of whatever we were reading or something we only talked about once in a lesson. He always had a ""not my problem"" attitude when you asked him for help and was very rude to his students for no reason. Didn't recommend me for honors even though I had an A average the whole year and yelled at me when I asked to override. He also called me the wrong name...on numerous occasions."
8257,He's a terrible teacher. You must go outside of class to get help so you know exactly what he wants. Classes are chaotic and uncontrolled.
8359,Mr. Bethem is a terrible teacher. Most of the time he gets off topic either telling personal stories or making fun of students. Every time you ask him a question he either tells you to read the textbook or answers the wrong question. It is basically impossible to get an A on anything. An 88% is the highest grade I've gotten in his class.
8461,"Very unhelpful, and hardly tells us material on tests. All he does is say read _______ and answer the questions that follow. We've never discussed anything and i have never gotten a single paper back."
8562,"If you want a teacher that assigns homework and then doesn't grade it OR show the kids the answers so they can ask questions about what they got wrong, then this is the teacher for you. Might be a nice guy, but a poor teacher, and leads to frustrated kids who don't know why they are missing test questions."
8664,"Mr. Walsh is the first teacher that has made me truly hate math. Whenever someone asked him a question or was confused he would answer "" guys you learned this a week ago"" as if we were stupid for asking a question. He never was useful during extra help so some of the students would go to Hall to be taught, instead of by him. Multiple times we had a test that nobody understood and we would all have to teach ourselves the unit. At times he would be funny and nice but as a teacher he is awful."
8766,"She was always in a bad mood. If you ask her questions, she will get smart with you and still leave your questions unanswered. She was only really nice with her cheerleaders."
8868,"a very ignorant teacher, not very helpful, does not prepare for college, very sarcastic. Has a old english style of teaching."
8970,"please teach us mrs. leblanc. Instead of giving us the easiest practice problem and then giving us homework problems we have no clue how to solve, you should actually spend some time teaching.."
9072,"Bad teacher, everytime someone asks her a question she explodes on them, she gave us a ridiculously hard research speech, which no other class before us had."
9174,He is burnt out at this point and needs to realize that a big choir is not always the answer. He is talented but doesn't know how to deal with students
9276,you take notes all class and its so boring on the first day of school he says you will learn more ss this year then you ever had but i havent 1 thing yet & he looks like santa
9378,"apparently saying that her husband is a deacon is the only answer she has. I mean seriously, all i asked for was a copy and she blew up saying that she couldn't because her husband was a deacon. Way uncalled for."
9480,worst teacher ever!! all you ever did in her class was take notes from the book everyday or color maps cause she never taught. She was very lazy and when you asked her a question she didn't even know the answer to it! All she did was sit at her laptop and email.
9582,A very rude teacher. There were multiple times I tried to give her an answer and she laugh in my face. She didn't like that fact that I was a good student even though i had a few missed assignments.
9684,"intolerant and easily confused. Never teaches, expects you to learn by yourself. If you bring up a question he'll try his hardest to be lazy and never give an answer. Plays favorites alot."
9786,"Twilight DVD will guarantee an A in the class. Join Team Jacob!
LAN Party every, single day!
Be sure to ask him for the word of the day and yell the crap out this word: ""NI!"""
9888,"Ms. Won is polite and respectful to students and she tries to make math class fun. However, she makes extremely difficult tests with content that wasn't on our homework or in our textbooks. She also brushes off questions and doesn't give a straight answer most of the time."
9990,"He is possibly one of the worst teachers that I have ever had. This man refuses to teach us material or give our class any type of work that is relevant to English. Instead we are graded on our ability to draw if I wanted to draw I would have taken visual arts. whenever a student asks a question he rambles on about something irrelevant to subject. On a side note if I really cared about your tennis career, I'd ask, but I never ask so stop talking about it."
10092,"He'll get mad if you base your projects off of cats everytime and type out everything in 1337 speak and use internet memes. If you Rick Roll him with an .exe that he can't click out of, he will rage pretty hard and try to find out who did it. If you don't know how to change your IP address, I dont suggest doing that. Also, handing in pictures of cookies gets you 85s. 1/10 on teacher scale."
