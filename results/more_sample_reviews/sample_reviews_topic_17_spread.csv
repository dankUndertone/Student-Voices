20,She doesn't seem to be doing her job. I still don't have my attendence fixed and it's been many months now.
40,It is sad when a well respected educational institution is forced to continue to employ personnel of such low quality purely in the name of tenure. Hoffman is a shining example of the failures of the tenure system and a true detriment to the Â“excellence
60,She is incapable of separating feelings from work. The worst moments of my time in high school have been because of her.
80,"After I was accepted to M.I.T., Mrs. Couthard suggested that I go to New River for a year to ""get some requirements out of the way."" A veritable fountain of worthless advice."
100,"She is very unhelpful and should be eradicated from her current position at san diego high, she has repeatedly changed the complex rules and regulations to her own liking and had not been very beneficial to the successes of any department in regards to extra-curriculars."
120,"Unsure if she is still teaching. Would be surprised! Hopefully, she is no longer working with children."
140,"Worst instructor in this world existing
highest grade in midterm was 92 / 100 for an engineer with us
2nd highest was 54 !!!! he deal with students as if they are engineers and professionals
personally i knew that this instructor passed through horrible experience in the past and he is revenging >>>"
161,"Mrs Keen, I had back in 1995. I have left high school, graduated college and am now currently a sixth grade teacher.I cannot describe how unmotivating and grouc"
181,"If this guy was awarded a teaching certificate, then I suppose Arnold Schwarzennegar should be governor of California"
201,"As a former student of hers who is now studying at an Ivy League school, I can honestly say that her teaching has made me a successful college writer."
221,"can easily cross the line, hers is unfortunately a compulsory busy work heavy course. I don't care about Desperate Housewives!!!"
241,"Kenneth Crook is a teacher NOT a professor according to my research so far.
No teaching credentials found....this worries me.
UVU students need degrees to excel in the workplace but UVU hires it's teaching staff based on experience only?"
261,This instructor assigned more busy work then my other three classes combined. Anytime I tried to get help or clarity the responses was delayed by days. Her responses were very abrupt and without tact. She was not approachable what so ever. She acted as thought she could not be bothered. She appears to go to great length to critique and discredits your answers. Worst instructor experience ever! She seems very detached and shouldn't be a teacher.
281,I had high hopes when she came and I've been continually dissapointed. She is unprofessional and leads with fear. She's not the leader she needs to be and the school is sufferning.
301,"Man, did I ever hate this class and its grungy kitchen! It's new now, but it won't take much neglect to get to its former state."
322,"I had him in '94-'95, and in 4 years of HS and 4 years of college, one of the WORST teachers I've ever experienced"
342,The worst mistake WEston Public Schools ever made was over-promoting her. The schools have gone downhills since she took over. She is not professional or intelligent enough to handle the community and garners no respect from students or parents. The standard has dropped because she hires terrible admins
362,i cant believe that the district appointed such a nieve woman to direct a high school. even the dumbest students are smarter than her.
382,Should be a coach not a principal! He pales significantly in comparison to the previous principal who created such an excellent community at Oakton High School. Many good teachers have left because
402,"Why must you continue to believe that your libralism is so much better than any other political or moral belief? Public schools banned True/False for a reason, Brother."
422,"I am not sure how Tammy Dodson spends her time, but it doesn't appear to be at the school. She is out more days than she is in. But that is not the problem. The problem is her lack of basic knowledge. I don't know how she is in a crisis because we've haven't had to deal with that, but when it comes to schedule repairs and college searches, she is worse than worthless."
442,Not a spectacular counselor. Did not help me at all with scholarships or colleges for my field. Only referred me to somewhere else.
462,She made so many mistakes in class that it led me to question whether or not she really IS a qualified professional.
483,"I was not prepared for the final exam, my peers in other classrooms were much farther ahead and ultimately, learned much more than I did."
503,He calls himself a guidance director...i could get more guidance from a rock. Seriously i was in there for scheuduling and the only thing i heard was how his grandson was in U of M
523,"If she thought she was as smart as she thinks she is she'd be great. Apparently, she comes from a long line of exceptional educators. Wow, if she does and if they are any reflection on her teaching and education ability we are in trouble!"
543,SHE HAS HER FAVORITES AS WELL AS HER FOES AND UNFORTUNITLY I FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. BUT THE FEELING IS MUTUAL!!!!
563,NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON STAFFING IN THE WEAK AREAS. Continue to eliminate weak teachers and stress academics not gimics.
583,"stormking should be played at a competition, NOT at a graduation! what happened to pomp and circumstance ?!"
603,"I think Ms. Baxter has every intention of helping but is too overwhelmed with her different positions at school, that she forgets that she has offered help in the first place."
623,never follows through with what he says. He is responsible for so many of the upperclassmen dropping out of band. The music has become easier than we played in Middle School. He wastes our time!
644,"Average to less than average. Clearly the kids don't like her at all. They say she is daft and inexperienced, but I like her jokes."
664,"I agree with that last rating! I am not a wrestler, just an ordinary guy with a B average, and I am nonexistent to her!"
684,"Was very disappointed with his teaching. Our student quickly became disinterested and is simply going through the motions until graduation. Has the potential to be an amazing teacher, but still has a long way to go."
704,tenure was a mistake because of her. wanted negative numbers for the ratings. she doesnt clarify or help @ all. nd i have her TWO YEARS!!
724,"he really should be teaching high school, not 7th. ive been degrated since i walked into that room and have been since."
744,"Reflecting on FHS several years later, she was one of the worst instructors- condescending and unforutnately didnt facilitate the learning process at all."
764,Our family was expecting a unique approach to learning. We are finding this experience to be unsatisfactory in many of the critical learning areas.
784,she is the most unfair woman i have ever met.i do not understand how st.mark's continues to allow her to teach there.
805,"she asked us where the auditorium was in the high school. she has worked there for, oh about 20 years. is she kidding?"
825,Mr. Gibson is an absolute lazy person who does not help you at all when needing help and always follows what the department it doing. If his name appears on your schedule go directly to the administration to have it changed
845,"Very unorganized and not the best person to be placing college decisions with. She is a nice lady, but in terms of being on top of the college process she is not the best."
865,"Considering the fact that most of the class dislikes her, I would say that my rating is reasonable. Perhaps if she does not come to class 10-20 minutes late everday, the ratings will change."
885,"Mr. Finken, retired in Iowa as a middle school principal, and is often absent or leaving early from his responsibilities from his job. He currently lives in Iowa and has never been a part of the community, let alone our state. He fools some by saying he has a room at Hotel Wilber, or more recently an apartment in Beatrice, but is never seen in those locations. This lack of integrity and work ethic by Mr. Finken has allowed Mr. Uher to run rampant. He has no more integrity than Mr. Uher!!!"
905,"Very disappointing, lacks good judgement and the skills it takes to be a leader. Over all ill equipped."
925,"One of the sweetest ladies I have ever met. However, she is incapable of controlling a classroom due to PTSD from an incident with a student a few years ago that resulted in her having a miscarriage. She also isn't very clear in her teaching and does not follow through on the promises about her class she makes at the beginning of the year. We didn't come close to having hw every day and I'm still waiting for the third instalment of ""Element Friday"". Lastly, this is not a ""college prep course"""
945,"Jason Simmons was horrendous as a Dean of Students. My children attended school within the Noblesville school district from Kindergarten to graduation. During that time, we received exceptional communication, guidance and assistance from all Noblesville schools... Until Jason Simmons entered our lives. He is unfit to work in education at any level."
966,"Doesn't turn in all college stuff in on time, have to constantly call and email for recommendations, and pushes state schools"
986,Considering the good ratings he is getting these days he must have tackled the demons he was wrestling with back in 1977. He was an unpleasant sort.
1006,She didn't contact me when I left messages for her and she never returned my emails. I feel that she doesn't make if very clear on how to get an A in her class. Very unclear!
1026,"Dr. Park is a decent guy but he doesn't fully understand the education laws he is supposed to enforce. When challenged, he will retaliate against the child. Would benefit from more training/experience."
1046,most boring class i ever took. i have difficulty understanding why she was awarded her teaching certificate. -CG
1066,"unprofessional.
when asked to write a college recommendation, he does not follow through. the day before it was due, he still had not completed it! unbelievable"
1086,I had her fresman year. My worst year ever. I did not like her. I am sorry for those of you who must suffer in the future.
1106,"Seriously, ""Conjunction, Junction"", ""The more things change, the more they stay the same"", ""I""VE GOT MY X-MAS LIGHTS HUNG"". Quotes from Colby...get out now!"
1127,Gives too much homework and is a total perfectionist. No real science only data tables and graphs. If you get her get a schedule change quick.
1147,"Horrible teacher. Definitely a contributing factor to why Forest Grove High School has the lowest graduation rate in Oregon. Completely insensitive to students, total disregard for the districts rules about grading. Is happy to single out students in front of their entire class for reasons that may or may not be within said students control. This woman should have her teachers license revolved and work in a federal detention center with criminals, not in a school with children."
1167,"While he claims that his aloofness in his teching style is to help us prepare for college, he must realize that we are NOT college students; we need direction!"
1187,"She shouldn't be teaching looking back on it. Doesn't really teach. Just shuffles through most stuff. Very boring and strict. Clearly favors athletes over all, to a point they will receive higher grad"
1207,Mr. Board is very disorganized and routinely produces incomplete labs without full sets of results. Students are forced to guess and infer what should happen instead of viewing the actual results.
1227,where do i begin i suggest anyone that would like to come to this school should really consider their options because guess what science is the most horrible subject in that school ms hernandez awful
1247,"i DID graduate three years ago, so perhaps things have changed, but mr. wagner did not teach at all...he was a facilitator. great guy, but what did i learn?"
1267,"If you somehow happen to get Bramlett for a teacher, apply for a transfer out immediately. It is indeed true that you get stupider from being in her class."
1288,"worst guidance counselor ever... no help what-so-ever, only thing he did for me was to squash my dreams of going to the college of my choice... told me I wasnÂ´t good enought."
1308,"I am currently the mother one of her students and coincidentally a former Spanish teacher. From what I understand, her methods are mundane, do not elicit class participation, provide no opportunities for functional communication and are downright tedious and boring. I am surprised and saddened that a school such as Yorktown would tolerate such mediocrity. Quality language teaching should be dynamic, interactive, unpredictable and applicable--elements that appear to be totally missing from her classes."
1328,"pretty much a total tool. shes nice and all but thats because shes a ""yes man""...who knows what sides she on. probably the administration because they're the ones paying her 100k salary. this is what public school has become"
1348,"I want to apologize for my disrespectful comment, which I have taken down. I was caught on the moment and spurred on by piers. I hope you take no offense to them, but i will not change my rating. I feel in class you have given up on us since it's your last year., but this has been going on for two years. I also believe you do not have adequate control over your class, allowing them to boss you around. And lastly you don't us; you either turn on a video or hand our textbooks and say do it."
1368,"Very disappointed to play ball under this man. When I arrived at Broadneck my Junior year, I was already being prepped as a potential D-1 recruit yet due to his own personal beliefs associated with my life outside of Broadneck, he did not provide me playing time, justification or opportunity. This man was detrimental to my success on the field therefore will continue to hold a negative outlook on his true colors. I therefore quit a game I loved in my senior year!"
1388,"Mrs Halpern's postcard ""class participation"" system is very unfair. She also says a lot of things that are false and tests us on imformation she did not teach."
1408,Well I saw our iStep scores today and Chesterton rates at the bottom of all the High Schools in Porter Co. (only Portage is lower). If I could change schools I'd go to Valpo.
1428,"Worst coaching experience of my life. His loud, pointless yelling, the ineffective nature of his old-school drills, and his inability to relate or understand his players made my basketball season one of the most discouraging and disenheartening times in my life. Incidentally, the focus he had on his daughter caused the rest of us to lose confidence in ourselves and each other, which has extended into long after the season ended. I would not recommend his coaching ""experience"" to anyone."
1449,"Mr. Perone always has been, is a hypocritical, self-glorifier. So, the world has already been saved? Not until people like you are stopped..."
1469,He keeps messing up my classes. Didnt know which classes were available for me to take. My parents had to see the principal to straighten my program out.
1489,A bumbling bungler of a man. The mere mention of his name produces chuckles from the students for a reason.
1509,"ok well...DON'T TAKE HIGH MATH!! the low math class don't get nearly as much hw and she likes us better. At least she's retirerd (or ""graduated"") so no one else can suffer...."
1529,"Doesn't understand how the school system works. Bad at teaching. Unconsiderate... Easy course, though."
1549,"What a self-important person...all she does the whole first semester is babysit students working on a typing program, and watses an exorbinant amount of time."
1569,Hated her. Bitter? Yes. Clarity? I've had much better by far. To never see her again made graduation all the more satisfying.
1589,"She was the most horrible counselor on campus. Discourages you, tells you lies about how you can't get into college, and when you do wants credit for it."
1610,Mrs. Christen has done nothing what so ever to help this school. She is ruining franklin as we know it. I feel sorry for the next generation.
1630,"As a graduate of USC, and as a reciever of the highest award of 5 beta capa, she grasps the ability to not only understand students but also has the best comebacks...nah nah nah nah nah"
1650,nice guy but is no deisciplinarian by any means. may work with the incoming 8th graders but not with the current students. rules are in place to be enforced not negotiated.
1670,"she expects us to get a perfect score (80) on the writing section of the PSATs, and claims teaching us for 3 days should have helped us achieve perfection."
1690,I've never found him helpful. You need a criminal record or a bunch of really annoying Post-it notes to get his attention.
1710,"Although he is a hard working teacher, he doesn't act in the best interest of the band, from depleting the program funds and cutting employees to make up for it, to setting a poor example by acting immature and without consideration the image his actions portray towards the music program."
1730,"I took her for stress management and the subject always goes back to her. YOUR STUDENTS ARE NOT A SUPPORT GROUP! stop reading into everything so hard, too......"
1750,"I took both acting and CRC, and came out of both with a very negative view of Nancy. She plays favorites, causes more conflict then she resolves, and is way too touchy feely. i wish i had more space.."
1771,Who would schedule teacher meetings on the first day of the Ohio proficiency tests and achievement tests? Do you have a calendar? Parents want to know what's going on.
1791,"Mr Vivers...where do I even begin with Mr. Vivers? He obviously doesn't teach math very well, look at the student's grades. It says it all. I have him for Geometry and I've been lost since day 1. He claims to be a former engineer, perhaps that was more of his fortÃ©. Being a teacher is certainly not."
1811,"He is lost in pre-engineering courses. He tries to help, but ends up making things worse. Protip, NEVER ask him for help. Go to your best peers."
1831,Dr. Wood took a personal dislike to me & it then reflected in her teachings.I feel that one should be able to separate personal feelings from school business.
1851,"Given the last three positive reviews and knowing Corey's tactics one would think it was Corey himself trying to save his reputation. Clearly not liked by the teachers, the administration and parents"
1871,"My Son Is somebody who most would genuinely consider a good and hard working student. He has perfect attendance and never gives me reason to worry. I got a call from the school saying he was absent for that class period. Confused, I asked him why he was late and he mentioned he was on time as per usual, however was sharpening his pencil as the bell had rung. In disbelief of a teacher marking an absence for this, I emailed the school with not much response. Took much work to resolve. No compassio"
1891,"She excused us a lot, although I think we could have done that for ourselves if given the chance. ;) She herself would get confused over material, so we didn't learn some things correctly"
1911,"I usually wait until I'm done having a teacher to rate them as I have done with past teachers. However, this option has come sooner than I thought. I will keep this on a professional level and not bring any emotions into this as some have done. I considered this teach a friend on occasion. But that does not excuse unprofessionalism and lack of knowledge. I have learned nothing from this class. In the end the class was causing mental stress on students beyond compare. Shame to see what happened."
1932,"She is not very helpful, and really unclear. She's absent quite a lot. But she is good for the APEX reccomendations, since she usually rates us good :) Prefer her over gibson if u score B- or lower."
1952,How did Mr. Barrett ever get to be a teacher. I thought he was still a senior in this school. I didn't know he had graduated college and come back!
1972,"Very bad teacher, if you can call him that. I was excited about an engineering course but he's changing my opinion"
1992,Test given without preparation of subject matter written within the test. Children feel uneasy with her comments.
2012,Mrs Cagan makes learning almost intolerable. My son along with many other students have almost abandoned the German language due to her inability to provide a consistent and positive learning environment
2012,Mrs Cagan makes learning almost intolerable. My son along with many other students have almost abandoned the German language due to her inability to provide a consistent and positive learning environment
2052,"I attended JPII for four years and was extremely involved and active in many different organizations. When she arrived my senior year she was negative from the beginning. Instead of trying to find solutions to problems in the French department she pointed fingers at the students and administration. She was the most unorganized, unprofessional, unwilling teacher I have encountered. I wish I had more characters to give specific examples of my experience. I dropped my last semester after 4 years."
2093,"In his class I am a percussionist. I have in many occasions been sabotaged by Brewer. I am not respected as an adult. He does not organize anything. I have been going to concerts that I took time to go to after school hours. On many occasions, I was unable to play due to lack of equipment. I have a snare drum at home that I've offered to bring that he has turned down. Then once I get to the concert, I either don't play or have a very small part."
2133,"No, in order to finish out her four year contract, they moved her to the Network and replaced her with a more teacher-friendly administrator"
2173,"Hey I'm a high school student i still remember her evilness. Let me just say she wore rainbow colored high socks to the zoo, and it was not a pretty sight!!!!!!"
2213,"The course is not challenging at all, my fellow peers like him and the course because it is too easy!"
2254,What a horrible guidance counselor. I have a 3.8 and great sats and she told me I couldn't get into a school which I was just accepted to.
2294,"I still got into college despite my bad grade in her class. Dont stress, you don't need to. She is too demanding!! 2 years was enough!"
2334,Avoid this person. He talks as if he is an educated elite yet is unable to complete a whole sentence without stuttering. Top 3 worst teachers i've had a jesuit
2374,"I graduated a couple years ago but just found out that you can rate high school teachers like you do professors. Dr. Anderson was terrible. It was obvious that he only wanted the school to look good and have high cst scores but did not care about his students. So many teachers would complain about him as well, and very excellent teachers I might add. So glad I only had to deal with him for a couple of years and not my whole high school like some students now."
2415,"I haven't even had you yet, but from what I've heard, I'm scared. I heard your anti-catholic or something."
2455,"Froner is now a principal at MHSHS. He does not do much to help the school. The previous ratings refer to the projects he hs intiitated at the schiool, and while they are great things-it's all in vain. The reputation of the school as a ""diverse and united community"" is an overstatement and only protected to increase rankings. Students often do not confide in teachers so they should be able to look to the principal for help-but that is not the case. Any issues brought up to him ...(cont.)"
2495,If you can manage to pay attention to her boring explanations of using Microsoft programs you should probably be able to get a decent grade. Don't except much in the helpfulness department though
2535,Popular only to those who have never had a problem or had to deal with the guidance office. It was a mess when my first child graduated and hasn't changed. Durbin will not accept responsiblity for any
2576,She'd be a fine teacher if she focused on her education technique as much as she does on Facebook and what I'm guessing is keyboard warrior vengeance. If you don't mind a teacher being against free speech and only accepting political correctness and nothing outside of that then she's the teacher you're looking for. I choose to invest in educators that don't intentionally strive to sabatoge personal lives due to petty online conflict. Unfortunately for me that's not Beatriz.
2616,"Lauren replaced Jessica as the head of school. She arrived on campus and immediately made many changes that many students and faculty members don't agree with. She got rid of the international interim options, she no longer allows candy to be given out by teachers to students, she restricted the food allowed for advisory and is in general not very nice to the students. She sits in her office and does not actually connect with the community, she just makes changes without asking anyone's opinion"
2656,For the people that adressed her as a good teacher..that helps you prepare 4 high school..that is not tru..n the person that said they've had her 4 5years..why urs only supposed to be n mid school 4 3
2696,"my child has paula emry as a counselor, and i am not very fond of her. my child is a high acheiving girl with a 4.0 gpa. However, mrs. emry did not allow her to take some ap classes. she stated that they were challenging and my child would not be able to succeed in the class. i know that she would have succeeded if she took the class. as a parent, im very dissapointed."
2737,"As a parent, I was disappointed to hear how he talks down to kids and lowers himself to talking like them. Hopefully he can do better."
2777,He doesn't seem to understand that teaching is his first obligation. We have to listen to so much garbage that does not relate to school.
2817,"I graduated WHS more than 6 years ago, and I want to write this review in HOPES that someone there will read this and give this to him. He ruined my hopes of higher education right after high school JUST by one math class. Being so negative, and condescending and telling me ""you will never amount to anything"". Well sir, I have amounted to something, and I will never EVER treat any human being like you treated your students then, and probably now. I have a few degrees now, and proud of myself. So skrew you."
2857,"He insulted me on the first day of my senior year in front of the whole gym. It wasn't cool. Needless t osay, I've disliked him for four years."
2898,I hated her and so did the rest of the class. We actually bonded over how much we ALL disliked her. Oh and no surprise she failed me and like four others and we couldn't graduate.
2938,his classroom management is saved by the special ed teacher in the room. walk past his room any given period at least five heads are down. worst boring teacher
2978,I had him as a teacher 30 years and my son had time. He has not changed one bit--still a boring and a difficult-to-understand teacher
3018,Arrogant bellarmine graduate. Cant teach and should be a counselor so he can continue to poke fun at students. Should go work in a private school.
3059,AWWWWWWWWWWFUL WOMAN. TERRIBLE. NOTHING GOOD TO SAY. BE READY TO RECEIVE THE MOST ARBITRARILY OBTAINED GRADES OF YOUR LIFE.
3099,I had her back in 07 and i have to tell you she does not know what she is doing and should have been replaced. I go to an art college now and my first semester of drawing was really hard. When i explained to my professor what i did in my senior yr of highschool he agreed i was not prepared well at all. To all interested art students: an A in high school art is a C or D in college art.
3139,"Well you tell us to many stories that have no point, and quite frankly are discusting...who wants to know that you discovered science while you were relieving yourself. c'mon!"
3179,"One of the most pompous people I've ever had as an instructor, in fact, ever met. ""Teaching"" graduate students by standing and reading a textbook for four hours? Very poor."
3220,"Did you know that the almost extinct Wiebesaur occasionally makes an appearance at our school! Never early, or on time, but somethimes it appears! Amazing right?"
3260,"Sholomon is nice, but she dosen't really give any freedom in what the student wants. She takes a long time trying to process anything the student wants. She's a bad guidance conselor to haveif you have your own acedemic decisions, but she is nice."
3300,"Ms. Migliore abuses her power as a educator. I changed everyday, participated, and completed all assignments, yet I was still given a B. I am a student athlete, who has received straight A's this year. The B she has given me is the only one I have gotten. She has taught me nothing accept a new bitter prejudice towards entitled gym teacher who think they are god."
3340,"AWEFUL, AWEFUL DIRECTOR. MAKES UNWISE DECISIONS. NEEDS TO STOP FOCUSING ON FUNDING FOR SPORTS AND FOCUS ON EMPLOYEES. IM SADDENED TO HEAR ABOUT THE LOSS OF AN EXCELLENT EMPLOYEE!!"
3381,wow how did you ever become a teacher. you and mrs. lake are so boring that's why i'm gonna drop your class like a bad habit!
3421,"Ms. Krier is a prime example of a teacher that abuses her power in the name of ""education"" and mistreats seniors. She seems to view girls in the classroom as inferior students to the other guys, and treats them as they always require help. Honestly joining her class could perhaps jeopardize your future and your grades, I DO NOT reccommend."
3461,"Mr. Rutter is The Bellaire Latin teacher. He is very absent minded some days, and will forget that activities have been done. This means that the class translates the same passage over and over again. He does not stick to what he says in scheduling tests and quizzes. He clings to the Cambridge Latin curriculum like a newborn to its mother. The tests are taken right from the course and they can be difficult to get high grades on because he has us teach ourselves. Overall, Mr. Rutter is not ideal."
3501,She didnt have any of her priorities strait.She had no idea how to teach an honors class.I was.01 away to getting an A but she didnt give it to me.I heard she changed one of her other students grades!
3542,"Unhappy with the experience my daughter had with Ms. Tai. Ms. Tai's homework never reflected the complexity of her tests, thus not really preparing the student. Lot of mistakes in test and hard to understand the questions framed by her. She was selective in rounding off grades. She did not follow text book methodology, making it harder for the student to follow. Overall, a very negative experience for us."
3582,"I respect that I am not a teacher and that I am still a teenager. However, I do not come to school to be taught my a woman who acts younger than me. She is rude. She is confusing. She dresses like a 15 year old and talks about sex with her students. With zero patience, you would think she would try and make the class understandable, but she sets herself up for failure by being the worst instructor at Bryant High. If you have Kim Cruse and cannot switch classes, switch schools. I am not kidding."
3622,"Terrible teacher. Simply terrible. required the whole class to write a group paragraph with a minimum of 12 sentences in 20 minutes, and gave everyone D's and F's."
3662,"Chip cravaak is a really nice man, but the worst teacher in the 11 years IÂ’ve been in school he gets his test questions from online, but his PowerPoints are from a different site, so they give 0 help to the students. It is beyond me how he made it into the house of representatives, and he should probable fix his powerpoints."
3703,You lucky students who have him don't know that after being CEO of 8 companies and CFO of 4 more he was actually a Harvard Professionalism teacher. God Bless
3743,"Ms. Moorman's class isn't particularly fun or invigorating, nor is she an enjoyable teacher to have. However, if you just keep up with the homework, the projects, and whatnot, you should get at the very least an A or B. With that being said, just buck up and put up with her. You won't get these opportunities in college. It's better to have a bad teacher now whose class you can still do good in than a bad teacher in college whose class you won't."

I can see why. You are basically teaching yourself if you are in his class. But hey at least you get an hour a day of nothing to do to yeah yourself."

Regularly assigning inconclusive projects that served no academic purpose, and then having the audacity to grade them with a strict and misinformed attitude. She does not understand the pecking order of classes at Moravian and students walk away from her class with nothing more than they walked in with but a newfound hatred of music."
3864,"In the depths of hell, the negative emotions of all of humanity gather and form an essence of pure evil and hatred. One day, this energy gained sentience and began to identify itself as Jenine, the slayer of all hopes and dreams. Jenine immediately began to wreak havoc on the earth. For years she decimated entire civilizations however she soon grew tired of this. Jenine eventually realized that she could make people suffer most by making their lives a living hell and thus, she became a teacher."

3944,"Rezac calls his class a workshop yet he forces you to do what he wants. He is a technology teacher gone wrong. Creativity is ""prohibited,"" only what he says goes. He forces students to, against their will, come in on a Saturday to present technology projects that they were forced to make. He has the things called paths, like robots or coding, but unlike a workshop, you have no choice, no options, no way to be creative with what you are given. He was mad at me for being off task!"
3984,"Ms. Bailey was also the worst part of my child's 6th grade year. She takes FOREVER to grade something, then by the time she does if she puts the assignment as ""missing"" or if something could have been fixed, its been so long that nothing can be done about it. She is very sarcastic and just overall is not the best. It sucks because at orientation she seemed like she was going to be one of my child's favorite teacher and mine but is far from it."
