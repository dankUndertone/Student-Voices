452,She is extremly disorganized and easily distracted from what she is supposed to do to get paid. Teach. She doesn't care about the students or their grades atall
509,"Idea of challenging is withholding information from students. Misleading notes, easily distracted, copies verbatim from textbook."
565,"This woman was the worst teacher I ever had. She knew less of the material than we did. She confused us by telling us the wrong information. She clearly does not enjoy ""teaching."""

735,"He isn't a teacher, he's a babysitter. I learned more about health from daytime television that i did from Lamp."

1414,"""Her lack of given clarity displays difficulty in her classes, but the main reason I dislike her is due to her way of singling out certain students. For example, a boy in my class is always picked on"
1470,"Feigenbaum- is a nice lady but an awful teacher. Her discussions go virtually nowhere, in fact, their almost completely content-less. Although she attempts at ""social programming"", it's ineffective."
1527,"Mrs. Bierwirth is a wonderful person, however she can't teach. During class, the students have to compete for attention because Mrs. Bierwirth talks to herself."
1584,"Mr. Poley is an intelligent man, but he is just not equipped to teach high school students. I feel bad that his potential is wasted at Woodward."

1753,he should not be teaching a top level band. he does not have the experience or knowledge. he also lacks control as well as respect from the students.
1810,Mr. Archangel has very little knowledge of the subject matter that he teaches. He has lectured on subjects many times and has to be constantly corrected by the students. Additionally he consistently interjects not fact but rather opinion into world and national events but tries to pass them off as fact. He's typically prepared for class and often seems as if he's trying to figure out what we are supposed to be doing. Grading policies are never objective but very subjective. Bad...just bad.

1980,She has the good concept of preparing students for college difficulty but is very bad at teaching and often gives way too much work.

2093,"I loved Culinary Arts 1 but the second year is a disaster. The curriculum is very disorganized, She cooks fairly good but is extremely laid back on discipline."

2206,"He's often very vague and isn't very helpful in developing writing. I like to write, but I haven't learned much in his class."

2319,"I hated this class, and have no idea why she is allowed to teach at all, let alone teach AP students."
2376,Mr. Johnson cannot teach chemistry for his life! All he does is confuse me with his wacko methods. He is also very rude to certain students at times.

2489,"Mr. Mikula has greater than 70% of his students consistently failing his class. He does not provide any quality instruction. For example, his teaching method is primarily look in the textbook answer the questions, if you can't figure it out on your own...too bad for you. He takes no ownership of the results of his instruction. So much for accountability...huh? I hope they bring charter school funding so some kids like me can get good math instruction. He does not know or care about us."
2545,Armada's class aint the kind of class I find that would make my life easier in the future but it has improved my vocabulary. I dont have much to say. It's very unclear.
2602,"very smart person but completely lacks the ability to actually teach. take her if you enjoy low grades on tests, teaching yourself, wasting a class period, and not being able to go in for help!"
2659,I strongly feel as though she doesn't ever listen to me and extremely unclear. She teaches with videos(um is that really teaching)
2715,"She focuses on too much critiquing, and not actually getting hands on with the subject. wish i got garner"
2772,Self-study is your only hope in her class. She pretends she knows the material well but only trails off to another topic whenever she can't answer your questions. Disorganized and irresponsible! She's
2828,"My son had the unfortunate experience of being in Ms. Taffaro-Chica's class. She is a very unpleasant person to communicate with, and my son was exposed to very little new material in her class. Overall, this was a compete waste of time."
2885,"Mr.Beahan was ""let go"" because of his poor teaching skills, use of profanity, and inability to follow school rules. I had him last year and didnt learn a thing,"
2941,I particuarly did not like ms. jackson because she was so unorganized and did not teach us very well. I am so glad she is leaving McMeans to teach at an elementary school!!!
2998,I absolutely would recommend this teacher! Lovely personality and beautiful hair! I love her teaching style! Her class was EXTREMELY good; the teaching style was truly impeccable! She is perhaps one of the most knowledgeable persons I have ever had the privilege of meeting! She is as knowledgable as the Renaissance polymaths of Da Vinci and greater!
3055,"I failed this class because she wouldn't show me how to export my final exam so I had to take a 0. She lacks review time, is untruthful, mean, and unintelligent. Her degree is in chemistry"
3111,He is absent from class often and is unclear and imprecise in his lessons. i have learned more on my own than from his class.
3168,Class is very easy! Minimal effort required to pass. She doesn't teach the material well enough for it to be any use to you in college.
3224,"Nicole is a very interesting teacher. although she tends to sit back and let the students do the teaching, she still is a very enjoyable person to be around."
3281,"No teaching involved. Either preschool work, or being ""inspired"" from her's. Always grades from her personal standards and not quality. Can't have ur own style"
3337,"she was never clear and if she could at least treat us with common courtesy please?did not know the curriculum, taught high school material to middle schoolers."
3394,"He knew the material but failed to present it in an interesting way, and did not do well explaining it.. He was always disorganized and usually pretty moody."
3451,"Extremely unorganized and clearly poorly equipped to teach an online class. Seems pretty lazy to just attach a calendar to the syllabus and expect everyone to go about their business without any instruction. She opened a quiz without ever announcing it. Really not looking forward to the rest of the class. I currently have another online class in which the teacher is extremely active, involved, and helpful. Not this lady, though."
3507,She can be very condescending and often gets lost in the middle of an explanation and gets students often lost. She does try to be very helpful but often confused students rather than helped them.
3564,He's not a teacher - he's a chiropractor. He conducts his class unprofessionally. he thinks that it's more important to fool around with the students than to teach them.
3620,"Oh gosh where do i start, first off she may have had all the good intentions in the world but that just doesn't make up for letting the talented students teach the entire course. She taught subject ma"
3677,"She is very useless teacher, and I would probably learn more from a rock. In addition, her tests are difficult not because of the content, but instead, of her incompetency of teaching correct and relevant materials. Many times, she grades in a very unfair manner, and tends to give much higher scores (up to 20%) to students she likes more. Also, she is very boring and does not answer questions clearly. If you get this teacher, good luck (because you will need it)."
3733,"honestly and solely on the basis of his teaching ability, he is the worst. he was unhelpful in and outside of the classroom. he clearly spends more time crafting his dull wit than his lessons."
3790,"The worst teacher I have had. Although I was one of the quicker students in her class, the only reason I passed the regents was by reteaching myself the year. F"
3847,does not know the subject matter at all! the only classroom she should be in is one where she is being taught the material by a PROFESSIONAL
3903,Made me drop physics. He should have retired long ago. Science is incredibly interesting and should be taught with enthusiasm and passion. Garland didn't do either. Try to get a different teacher!!
3960,"The topics that we are covering seem easy, but she is making it 20 times harder!"
4016,One of the most disorganized teachers I have ever had. I thiink he gets rigid because he is so disorganized. Not a whole lot of intellectual steam.
4073,Has her head up in the clouds. Very difficult to learn from. Very unclear. Often annoying. (But I suppose she is also a nice person.)
4129,"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach and never answers questions, only leaves the students more confused. He also reiterates everything that isn't important. He once attempted to teach us something even he didn't know how to do, leaving all of the students angry and confused. He uses the textbook to teach. As in, he reads right off it. He has no structured class and cannot manage time. He mumbles to himself and is quite rude too sometimes."
4186,"This man has absolutely no idea how to teach, much less in chemistry (which he apparently failed three times in college.) One of the more veteran teachers has to come in and teach him new concepts."
4243,He sucketh! God the man is a robot! I mean seriously how can one learn from someone who likes to teach in a lecture style and has the world's ultimate monotone!!! Argh.
4299,"Has difficulty focusing the class. Work is very unproductive, but time consuming. Too opinionated in her teaching. Looks down on students as inferior."
4356,WOW tries to be nice but only is to her favorite students. tries to teach but cannot convey her knowledge to students. obviously does not like her job.
4412,complete lack of knowledge concerning her field of teaching. No desire to teach or help others learn. Overall affect of making students hate english
4469,"She is fluent in spanish but lacks teaching strategies. Often puzzled as to what her unit objective is daily or what the assignment entails the student to do. Extremely easy class to succeed in though, more upside than downside."
4526,He goes off on tangents too much.He doesn't get half way through the lesson plan but I must admit he's humorous.
4582,"Unfortunately I have Mr. Freiler again this year. If I want to learn I have to do it on my own because movies dont teach, a teacher does"
4639,"She just doesn't really teach, i could go home and take the spanish course she offers, there isn't much dialogue or even enthusiasm."
4695,"she had favorites, hated intelligent people when in bad moods. my ability in spanish has decreased and from being my favorite, it's now my most hated subject. useless class."
4752,She is super fast paced and the students teach the students so she doesn't teach and gets paid... Horrible teacher
4808,She's not so great as a creative writing teacher. She tries to force the technique rather than suggesting ways to make yours better.
4865,"Hmmm...Mr. Swartz can be a little challenging. If you enjoy teaching yourself the material, you would really like him. If not...Good Luck."
4922,marks for anything which are not even related to school and poor teaching style. She would mark you off for the stupidest of reasons and you will find are quite unreasonable
4978,"Sweet muffins, she knows nothing about teaching OR the subjects that she teaches. She gives out pointless busy work and projects meant for kindergarteners. She also told us that she is experimenting with her teaching methods on the two psychology classes that she ""teaches"" without our written or verbal consent, which, due to its effect on our grades (and therefore our futures) is unethical (and she has expressly told us that this type of experiment is unethical!)"
5035,"Monica Edwards does not teach in a logical fashion, and the information she provides is vague and often contradictory. Her class is incredibly frustrating for those students who take school, learning, and earning top grades seriously. This is the most frustrating teacher my child has had as the teachers (s)he has had in Glastonbury have been superb. Her class, thus far, has served to decrease my child's understanding; this is not good."
5091,she shouldnt even be labeled as a teacher considering she lacks the teaching part i nearly failed western civ because she made us read and then didnt teach ANYTHING.
5148,"He is a bad teacher. It's as simple as that. He is knowledgeable about his subject, and has a lot of experience with film, but he is bad at teaching it. His class is just busy work and a few projects. The only good thing about this class is how easy it is and how little work you'll do. He puts huge restraints on you creativity, and is extremely passive aggressive. He doesn't know how to control his classroom. He is just a bad teacher."
5204,Ms. Uscian is a nice person but a pretty bad teacher. In discussions she never answers questions and only reinforces other questions without clarifying any of their answers. I feel like she has somewhat knowledge in what she teaches but the way she delivers it is so unclear. Always assigns busy and useless work. She is very unclear when teaching content and info.
5261,"She has absolutely no knowledge of the subject. She herself admitted that she learned ""90 to 95 percent"" of the material with her students, in an introductory Java course. Her tests, instead of focusing on coding and programming, were on theoretical concepts which are of no practical use. Her voice is irritating to listen to as it is a high pitched screech and the words that come out of her mouth are more often than not meaningless. She brings shame to both MSU (her alma matter) and Novi."
5318,"Amy Bien is completely clueless and incompetent teacher. I had her in a basic Child Development class and could not have made my experience any more dreadful. Her teaching style is poor. The notes taken in class are general and give no actual insight to the material. Her attitude toward students is completely condescending and bias. She will mark you late if you are not in your seat 2 minutes BEFORE class. Personally, I am utterly opposed to her as a teacher. Her salary is a waste if tax dollars"
5374,His lessons make you want to go to sleep. His current events articles assignments seem unnecessary for Government.
5431,"She may know a lot about science but she doesnt know anything about how to teach. She was confusing, she jumped from subject to subject without any transition, and when i took one of her classes with a couple friends we had to re-do half of our assignments because she lost them and gave us a 0 for our grades. if you can find a way to get out of her class......DO IT!!"
5487,NEVER answers your questions. Seems to be oblivious to the fact that the purpose of school is to actually teach something. Needs to lighten up.
5544,Ms.Conner has low knowledge ability of english. She is more of a Art teacher and she should just stick with that. I learned close to nothing.
5600,"I'm just thankful that Mrs. Adkins is teaching me an easy subject- Geometry- rather than Algebra II. She's so ridiculously boring, and has a bit (okay, a VERY) sloth-like teaching style."
5657,"Ms. Coleman is by far one of the most incompetent teachers I have ever had the misfortune of being assigned to. She has no clue what she is teaching and spends days talking in circles about simple subject matters that should be taught in less than an hour. Her teaching style is ineffective and students wonder how they are going to pass constantly in her classroom, how are the kids supposed to understand a subject when a teacher can't even teach it?"
5657,"Ms. Coleman is by far one of the most incompetent teachers I have ever had the misfortune of being assigned to.

5770,"It's impossible to understand her through her accent. She's gives up on anyone who doesn't instantly understand what she is saying. The only way she knows how to teach is through repetition of random problems. It's a good thing the other math department teachers have the ability to give you a real understanding of mathematics with a real passion for the subject, both of which C-Spotts Lacks."
5883,"Her class can teach you a lot because of the intensity of the course and the work that we have to do. it's very good practice. but as a teacher she is superficial to the extreme. she's so friendly to people when they walk in the room, but she's not interested in getting to know kids or helping them out. talking to her personally is like talking to a cop without coffee."
5996,"She's not stupid, she's extremely, extremely foolish. She can't think straight and can't figure out what's wrong with her teaching and her class. Hopeless."
6110,"he's an entertaining conductor and he knows his music, but he should NOT be teaching ib music. his lack of organization and communication makes the class a joke."
6223,"she is so confusing. she is nice, but once she's teaching she's just horrendous. boring class and she cannot explain material well. she expects a lot, but doesn't put in enough effort for the students to get the gist of what she's teaching. she won't curve. ever. don't even bother asking."
6336,"Mr. Paul's instructions are rarely clear and class periods are boring and the same repetitive thing everyday. He is unclear with his ""projected presentations"" and only lets us speak our minds if called on. He is agonizingly repetitive and gives students hardly any time to work independently. This teacher is not on my list of past good teachers."
6449,She lack knowledge of the subject and doesn't teach. Almost all the work you do won't be graded and the stuff that is graded is a F or D. She uses logic so poorly that it adds to confusion that and she tells everyone about tests and quizzes last minute. If you have her switch out.
6562,"Hmm . . . actually, he rates among the most disorganized and unclear teachers in the history of bad teaching. I suspect that he doesn't understand calculus."
6675,"My child is so behind in what he should know, it's a shame. Her energy does make up for lack of class control and appropriate content."
6789,"grrr..copeland. though i do not hate him, i do dislike his methods of ""teaching"". grammar, essays, & grading are weaknesses of his."
6902,"Completely unhelpful and vague. Good writer, but she definitely demonstrates a CLEAR lack of knowledge outside of literature. Can't understand simple requests, makes assumptions, etc."
7015,Bored me to absolute death every class with lectures that no one paid any attention to. heavily uses textbook work and will not try to make class interesting in the slightest. I decided to not take another year of Spanish solely because my experience with her was so horrible.
7128,"Disregard all previous positive comments made about Mrs. Bramlett. Those reviews were evidently made by her favorite students. I had the luck of being one of her favorite students, yet I too was able to see the incompetence of her teaching. The majority, if not all of her instructions are very ambiguous. She attempts to ""clarify"" her instructions by giving rubrics with each assignment, but these further the confusion. Sadly, a 500-character review will not do justice to reveal her inadequacy."
7241,"Switch out if you have him, poor learning experience and very depressing to be around, speaks poorly of his own qualifications to work at the school. Very unmotivated to teach or learn for that matter. Has the hand writing skills of a special-needs 3 year old. And overall a jerk of a teacher to deal with. Very objective and must be his way when it comes to work, cannot get in depth of ur own research unless it favours what he thinks as well. If u have him SWITCH OUT!"
7354,"Lazy. Very underqualified to teach high-school level sciences. She has endangered a classroom by leaking dangerous acidic chemicals into the air forcing an evacuation. She has admitted to ""assigning cornell notes when she is clueless in a topic"" (which is every day."
7467,"I thought we didn't have money, but we have to pay her to teach, then pay to re-teach half of her students during the summer! Wierd logic!"
7581,"I think the poster about cheese and wine is Ms Simmons herself, because she used to say that. Unqualified to teach, often misspelled simple words on the blackboard and made us teach grammar to her."
7694,"Dana Bryant is the opposite of a teacher. Every single day I have walked into her class and she has been sitting at her desk, staring at her laptop, where she remains for the entire period. She finds assignments on the internet over subjects she hasn't taught us - because she doesn't teach - which are too difficult for us to feasibly complete. Her absolute absence of any knowledge of physics means that she is wholly incapable of assisting us at all which leaves us helpless and with poor grades."
7807,"I don't know what's wrong with these other reviews but Mr. Benson's class is completely ridiculous. He thinks he's some kind of math genius because he created these videos of his lessons for you to learn at home and practice in class (it's mainly because he's lazy and doesn't like to teach lessons). Sadly, he's not, and his sassy attitude and self-indulgent asides don't help matters. Tests are weighted at 70%, which is completely ridiculous, he has no sense of humor, and can't teach. Switch out!"
7920,"Soliman is absolutely horrific. She hands out HW that she expects students to apply their math skills they learn in class to solve the problems...twist is that she does not even teach the basics or any at least tangentially related material required to critically apply knowledge for solving. Also, she never posts on schoolloop, so missing homework has become a common occurrence in this terrible classroom. If you get her, expect studying a lot from txtbook, and asking too many Q's = she gets mad."
8033,"Needs Improvement or a heart, If I were grading her teaching abilities I would give her a D because she doesn't care if she gets through to her students."
8146,"Someone already said it, she makes it seem like she is teaching, but when you actually have to use the teachings you will realize just how little she actually taught. The constant sound of boy bands in the class was extremely annoying from day one."
8259,"Although the tutorials are very easy to follow, he doesn't answer anyones questions, and likes to insult people (although poorly)."
8373,"Ms. MgGuire doesn't know much, a little but not much, her teaching skills and study skills are wretched, and the homework assignmets made me cry. She spent all our time on pointless study guides"
8486,"The year I had her, it was her first year in about 25 years teaching an eight grade class. Maybe that justifies her lack of knowledge in her subject? I did appreciate it when she tried harder in the second semester (I suspect because people were complaining). She gives us inaccurate information on worksheets when we ask for help. Then, we get that problem wrong while correcting and she claims to have not told us that information! She doesn't follow through on detentions with disruptive kids."
8599,"Ahhh - very frustrating teacher . Does not prepare lessons or examples for class.
Expects all kids to learn the same way won't make accommodations. Just reads powerpoints. QUIT Teaching"
8712,"Why do they let her teach the HONORS Chemistry? Someone else has to be able to do a better job? I can't believe we watch so many movies in Chemistry, give me a break, teach and stop yelling at us like it's our fault!"
8825,"She does not know anything. She is extremely vague when talking about a subject, and she makes you use passes to go to the bathroom! She need to listen to the students more, and become a better teache"
8938,I think mrs hoijer changed her teaching methods because older students loved her and most my age thought she was terrible. she never explained clearly and did pointless activities instead of learning.
9052,"She is biased towards some of her students, and she just makes us read from the the textbook and expects us to know what everything is. She only uses her enthusiasm to encourage people or be lazy on her phone, and she almost never answers a question anyone has to ask her."
9165,"Mrs York is now a Social Studies teacher. She likes to mark kids down for dumb things like coloring, capitalization, spelling instead of grading for knowledge. She definitely favors the girls in the classroom. She will not go out of her way to provide any additional help unless she absolutely has to. She should just retire and do it quickly."
9278,"She knows what she is talking about and she is able to communicate one-on-one with students. But in class, she is completely useless. She is the worst teacher I have ever had. She can be nice, but she also lies like it's going out of fashion. She says she's taught us certain things that appear on the test, but very often, this is just another one of her lies. She confuses herself and her class on a daily basis. With that said, I've learned in her class; the only issue is that I taught myself."
9391,"I honestly find it difficult to wrap my brain around just how unintelligent Norma Vakil is. I came into her class almost able to speak spanish, and i left having forgotten it all."
9504,"I had him for Chemistry. He never taught one lesson on chemistry, so significant figures, no network solids, no nothing... my class complained to the principal and we were told to learn it on our own. needless to say i was the only one in my class that passed the regents because i studied with my girlfriend who was a straight a student in another class."
9617,"She is incapable of teaching AP psych. She literally asks how she should be teaching, and when each student responds differently it's no surprise we get nothing done. Wost class, biggest waste of time"
9730,"I did not like her at all. She is a first year teacher, who definately cannot replace Mr. Mac. Her lessons were always boring and she does not know how to teach yet."
9844,"He is one of the nicest and chill teachers at Westview...however his teaching is terrible. He always goes off topic and assigns way too much unnecessary labs and homework that he doesn't help you with. Unless you plan on teaching yourself the whole course, I HIGHLY suggest to drop."
9957,"My son could not learn anything from this teacher. He constantly seems as if he does not know what he was teaching. My son went to him for help with his math, and Mr Kaseman would seem uninterested."
10070,"Dr. Del Cerro is such a nice person......but she can't teach Bio for her life. The only students that can excel in her class without a major curve are those who already have a background knowledge of Bio and don't have to listen to her awful lectures. Example: Her ENTIRE circulatory system lecture was 20 min, and it was the worst lecture I've ever heard. Ask her a question, and she, as well as the"
10183,"My daughter was her student last year, she makes the subject complicated & confusing. This subject should be interesting but she is very bias in rating the students in terms of their efforts. Inconsistent & very personal on her basis with the kids."
10296,"Mr. Donnelly clearly choses favourites for every class, and manages to give them special treatment. On top of that, he also manages to be cruel to others - sometimes making the whole class very uncomfortable with his questions and general aggressiveness. Although the class itself isn't terribly difficult, he is not always clear when trying to explain things and this can make lessons more tedious that necessary. Overall, I think that he could drastically improve his teaching if he were kinder."
10409,"She is a very bad teacher. I remember last year For the research paper, we had to use 4+ books in order to research information on our topic and we could only use 2 Internet sources. Many kids got a bad grade on their project because all the books on a certain research topic were checked out or were unavailable due to some topics bein so vague. She acts like English is our only class and she herself doesn't know much about the material we cover such as author's works or even book themes."
10522,You may not really learn much in 5th grade with Ms Ryan. Just talks of stuff that hasn't a thing to do with the subject she is suppose to teach. Offers no real help to any student & doesn't care to. Also doesn't make instructions for work in a clear way even when you ask her. Gave too much exams to write about that didn't deal with classwork. Went way off topic.
10636,"No matter what he convinces himself of, discussions don't promote teaching. It's too abstract if material is unlearned, so discussions rely only on opinions. At some point, the opinions are repetitive.As for the format of his tests and discussions, they are not conducive to learning. His test format requires specific knowledge he assigns that AP books for APUSH don't quite have, and he doesn't assign essays enough - only on tests, and the formatting is oppressive.""discussion roles"" do same ^"
10749,"Well we've been approaching learning but i doubt we'll ever get there. Ms. Winchesters assigns essays like we've got nothing better to do. Shes a new teacher and it definitely shows with her lack of authority, experience, her ability to care wayyyyy too much, etc. She disregarded the IBCP curriculum by requiring all mandatory service hours by the end of junior year, with a certain number due at the end of each nine weeks."
10862,"Mean spirited and condescending. He did not provide a safe environment for me to learn and is quick to make fun of students to up his credibility. ""Open notes"" policy is an easy way to feign accountability for students while making it seem like he's competent at teaching material. Actively favors ""smart"" students with photographic memory rather than promoting diligent study habits that will have greater returns in college in the long-run."
10975,"Mrs. Heistad helped me learn Chemistry. She isn't a very clear teacher, and doesn't explain much, but with extra work, I learned the meterial she was trying to teach. The end of the year project is what set me off. She graded us on what we didn't present, not on what we did. She expected us to know more than we did, instead of learning from what we presented. As a person, she's easy to talk to."
11088,"Homesick for your grade-school substitute teacher (that hands-out worksheets instead of actually teaching) ? This class is for you! Complete with scan-tron multiple choice and regurgitation of text book diagrams (recycled annually). Save your time and money, buy the book and read it yourself. Professor adds nothing to the material except a bad attitude."
11201,"Ms. E is two-faced.
Some days she can be fine, calm and teaches well.
However, other days (most days) she's strict, moody, does NOT teach well and contradicts herself. She can NOT control her eighth graders and her favoritism is humiliatingly obvious. She is afraid of her confident students who are not afraid to challenge unjust statements. She needs to stop speaking spanish all the time and focus on teaching. I've had many problems with her.
One of the worse teachers I've had."
