56,I HATE HER! i learned nothing in her class and now i am struggling through honors classes in the high school and i have to catch up for all of last year
113,"90% of the class is about himself, 10% is about physics. I learned more teaching myself than in his class. Unless you want your GPA to suffer, avoid his physics class at all costs!! It's sad that he is the only physics teacher in Gab. This guy should be fired and replaced,"
170,"I believe this is referring to Chris Barth. If so, the only thing you'll learn from his class is how to color. Total waste of a year."
226,"ok, I learned nothing in this class and it was a waste of time. you have no clue how much I wanted to be transfered out of it. complete waste of my life."
283,Sometimes you just wish you had never taken a class since it was a waste of time. This is one of those classes. I did learn what melancholy meant. That's all!
340,"Worst teacher in history. If you want to have easy A, take Smryl's AP Physics Class. Don't take regular, because there is no difference between the two classes."
397,"""Honors"" isn't ""A.P.""!!! seriously, ten-fold harder than last year's honors class...you really must be dedicated to ONLY ENGLISH if you want a respectable grade"
453,She does not do what she says she will. I did not learn anything from her the entire semester.
510,"she screwed up my schedule literally 4 times in 1 yr and signed me up for classes i didnt want and claimed i wanted them and before looking at the card, she made it seem like i hacked the comp 4 them."
567,She's a terrible teacher. If you get her you should transfer out unless you want a long and stressful year.
624,"Ms. Castle gave up on me. I was in her AP Chemistry class, and seriously could not learn anything. And I'm usually wonderful in science. Now in regular Chemistry with a different teacher, doing great."
680,you dont learn anything and she's oblivious to the cheating on tests that happen in her class. the class is so far behind in history compared to other classes
737,"Mrs. Riley(Zinger) was nice, but she was a God awful teacher. I had her for two out of the 6 english classes I took at York and hers were the only classes in which I got low B's/high C's. In fact, having her my Junior year ended up discouraging me from taking AP English. I showed my essays to my English teacher this year and she pretty much called me an idiot for NOT taking AP."
794,i learn nothing in her class....half the time i have to go on youtube or something to learn the material......
850,"The class equivalent of a string documentary, of which he actually showed in class"
907,i didn't learn very much in his class we spent too much time talkign about the holocost and it is depressing. i wish he challenged me more. it was fun though.
964,"during history, we take about 15 minutes of class time to listen to the news. we should be using that time for actually learning curriculum hence why we are behind other history classes. personally, i learn nothing in that class. i learn about how great his psychology class is and listening to songs from the 1900s."
1021,She doesn't understand that she has level classes and makes it PRE-AP English
1077,he is a very unhelpful teacher and actually does grade unfairly. There is nothing uselful anyone can learn in his class.
1134,YOU BETTER LOVE VISUAL BASIC AND USING TEXTBOOKS CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU WILL DO IN THIS CLASS
1191,"The class was too easy. I didn't learn anythning the whole year. I agree with below, she just googled assignments. Nothing her own. Pretty much a study hall. Do NOT take business with her if you actually want to learn."
1248,"Who ever is in his class. You better get extra help on English, cause You wont learn anything from his class."
1304,"I hated the class when I was in there....but looking back, it was by far the best class I've ever taken at Garfield."
1361,"Not very helpful. his classes are more exercises than actual teaching. i learned nothing during tham, except for stage combat second semester..."
1418,She spent literally an entire six-weeks complaining about what bad students we were simply because a few kids in the class could not understand the material. Bi-polar. Avoid at all costs... for sanity
1474,she didn't teach us at all. i am sorry that mrs. vuko had to leave. my freshmen year should have rocked. the class was wild and nothing was accomplished.
1531,"ill put it this way. time spent ""teaching us"" about europe-100% amount of europe questions on the exam-10%"
1588,"one of the easiest, most pointless classes ive ever taken...she has no control over classes and she seems to hate me just beacuse i have an A+ in her class..."
1645,"DUARTE IS DEFINATLY THE WORST TEACHER INSCHOOL, I LEARNED NOTHING ALL YEAR AND DEFINATLY DOESNT PREPARE YOU FOR HONORS Bi learned more about tatoos and rugby than math last yr!"
1701,She had no idea what the heck she was doing. She kept experimenting pointless projects that wasted time. I learned nothing.
1758,"Great guy, funny to talk to...out of class! Not the best AP teacher, advisable to transfer out of his class regular or not."
1815,"Kirby has definitely created a legacy for himself. My older brother despised his class as much as I did. You learn nothing, and it's WAY to cold in his room."
1872,Doesn't prepare you whatsoever for college. I had to start over from scratch after I spent the first year finding out that I wasn't ready for the classes I should have been.
1928,Unless you are planning to be in the plays or musical drop this class ASAP!!!!! He is horrrriiiiibbbbbllllle!
1985,"she was soo mean to me and my friend. if you get this teacher, it would be worth switching classes because Mr. Tuomi is SO much better!!"
2042,"dont listen to all these people. she may be a good person, but her class is all busy work. YOU LEARN NOTHING! its is a waste of time and will ruin your life"
2099,"at first it was nice to have basically a free period in the middle of the day, but by 2nd quarter it was a huge disappointment. She doesn't realize the entire class takes advantage of her, it got to a point where everyone was getting passes to lunch or bcc. Switch out if you want to learn something."
2155,"I hate her! I've had SO much trouble dealing with her that I'm transferring out of her class at the end of the semester, and even though that means I will go from IDS to Regular."
2212,ive been in her class for a week and im already ready to just request a class switch. shes ridiculously boring and her voice is shrill it drives me nuts.
2269,"It's the easiest class ever, but that has nothing to do with the teacher. it's the most simple class with the most simple minded teacher. A one time she spent 7 minutes trying to get us to save a physical piece of paper to our documents in the computers. At least it's an easy A"
2325,She hates everything especially freshman i seriously hope i dont have her for english next year. everyone even skips her class bc of her. I didnt learn anything in Advanced Communications.
2382,"He may know about physics, but he is absolutely useless in explaining it. His exams cover things that we never went over in class and the entire class feels entirely unprepared to take the AP tet"
2439,Don't get Intro to Journalism. It's the most unorganized class ever wtith the most unorganized teacher ever.
2496,"Very nice man, but one learns NOTHING in his class. It seemed cool when I had him, but now I know nothing about history"
2552,You learn nothing about english in this class! One of the worst teachers ever! Everthing is very last minute with him. He will give you projects that have nothing todo with english. Final is HARD!!!!!
2609,"Unless you want to do nothing, sign up for this class. For me, I wanted to learn something and get good grades (since his classes were really easy). In return I received tons of projects that have nothing to do with the course and a bad grade (comparatively).TL;DRget him if you want a free period, not for educationget on his good side so that you aren't biased again"
2666,"Very unhepful, avoid this teacher at all costs!Will hurt you not help you IM SERIOUS! I had her for two years and i still regret ever having her."
2723,She packs her class with busy work and has some ridiculous mood swings. I really wish i was learning more. At least she asks for help from other teachers.
2779,Walking into this class i was hoping that this would be a career choice for the future. This man ruined this for me. i regret taking this class. hes a horrible teacher
2836,"I took her class as a freshman, and there was no doubt that I was smarter than her when it comes to math and common sense."
2893,"I did not learn a single concept in the Honors course I took from him. He is a nice man, but should stay in the coaching field."
2949,"she's a terrible teacher, you do the same thing every week for the whole year and she's really confusing and you move really fast and dont take time to actually learn things like you did in middle school. it's awful"
3006,"She is a hot mess, very nice person but a horrible teacher. She claims that she is preparing us for college but I learned zilch throughout the whole entire semester !!"
3063,I do not enjoy her english classe because she assigns more home work than my AP World and Honours Chem classes combined. She things she teaches you things but its up to you to teach your self complete
3120,The class was pointless the only time we worked was with subs(which we had alot) and when he was mad. Hated the class!
3176,Mr. Gibson is nice...thats not the problem. He is very strict and doesn't help a lot. His class is reuining my whole freshman year... Thanks Mr. Gibson...
3233,i have below an A in his class (regents-level). colleges will not like that because they know that regents classes are the lowest possible level in high school (even lower than regular classes).
3290,"Wow. I took her honors chem class one year, and the next year, everyone in her class was unprepared for AP chem. wow. what a terrible teacher. we don't learn anything."
3347,She really doenst know what shes doing!! she changes her lesson plan like every second.. -_- i cannot stand being in her class at all.. she grades very harshly too
3403,"Her class is extremely easy... because you don't learn anything and she won't test you on much. Her exam questions are basic and very unhelpful. If you're aiming to get a 5 on the AP Physics 1 exam, you'll have to study on your own. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had; you won't be able to learn much in class. If you wish to truly be prepared for AP Physics C, I recommend that you take Physics Honors or get tutored. Don't waste your time in this ""challenging"" AP class."
3460,"I felt extremely disappointed about art after taking this class. Yes, there were moments that were fun, but I can say I left this class not ever wanting to take an art class ever again. She had nothing nice or constructive to say, and I'll admit that class left me going home in tears on multiple occasions... If you are seriously interested in art, don't bother taking this class. Or any other art classes at Bailey Middle School."
3517,She is never there on time and we goof off a lot. I agree that a college prep class would have been a better choice than this class.
3573,"Awful teacher. I'd say 4/5 days of the week, her class is just doing nothing. She's always too busy with Districts or the plays going on. She doesn't pay attention to her classes so we just do whatever, basically."
3630,You will learn nothing in her class. She thinks she is intelligent but she knows nothing and can't teach at all.
3687,"we suspect he enjoys children the same way that micheal jackson does, if you get my drift. most horrid teacher ever; practically does not teach at all. please transfer out of his class."
3744,"I didn't learn anything from his class, I had to find the information myself. I felt that a lot of time was wasted when it could have been spent teaching us the information we needed to know."
3800,"Heh, Duff is one cool guy. Although he's gone, I had him for IPC, and he taught absolutely nothing. But he's a nice person, so I enjoyed his class."
3857,"I did not like his English class. He would be better as a philosophy-type teacher than english. He does not answer your questions straight-forward. Also, his tests are very specific."
3914,I have had nothing bad to say about teachers except for this one. I had to switch classes when I took chem in 1994!! Doesn't speak or instruct clearly! I lost interest quickly
3971,"Johnson is not clear at all, and she doesnt even write notes for her advanced classes, I would recommend switching out of her class if you get her."
4027,"If you know what is good for you, then you will NOT take AP Stats. I have learned absolutely nothing from her. The only way to get a 5 with her is to self study"
4084,All of the classes are the same. He needs to change up the curriculum to match the course. I should not have to study tractors in a flower class.
4141,I took psych AP and didn't learn a thing. I used everyday as a study hall because nothing she ever said in class was relevant. Do not take this class if you expect a 5 or even a 4 on the AP test
4198,If you want to quit your instrument- join her class. If you want to hate music- join her class. If you want to experience mental and physical torture- join her class. 'nuff said.
4254,This man watched me get tortured in his class each and every single day by other students and he sat there laughing. I didn't do anything but put my name on papers because I hated him so much. And I still managed to get an A in his class. I learned NOTHING.
4311,"Took his AP Physics class. Homework consisted of writing down notes on videos he made on YouTube. Little to no learning in class. We usually completed problems on WebAssign with occasional help from him. All in all, he seemed more like a proctor than a true teacher"
4368,I had her for one semester and then I switched out. She was very nice to me once I wasn't in her class anymore.
4424,"Nice guy but horrible teacher. I had him for Physical Science and he was horrible. We did nothing in his class and when we did, we didn't learn anything..."
4481,"Her assignments are tedious and monotonous, just as is her voice and her whole being in general. Not a very fun class at all, and I love English!"
4538,sh'e so boring and definately has personal favourites.. i hated that class so much and would advise anybody to switch out of it to another level!!
