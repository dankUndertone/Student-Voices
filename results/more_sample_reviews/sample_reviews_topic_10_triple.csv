33,He doesnt help us at all and tells each other to help each other and doesnt know anything
67,"She really made it hard for me. She counts off on everything! Even if you have the right answer in 6 steps, she wants you to show all 9 steps. What was frustrating was if I had an answer that showed X=6, and I didn't put down 6=X, it would be counted wrong."
101,she doesn't help us at all and when u ask her a question she doesn't want to help and she doesn't let u correct her because she thinks she is always right even when she isn't and she doesn't let us go
135,"She doesn't let us ask questions, and she isn't quick to accept it when we try to give an answer she wasn't expecting or wanting."
169,"I corrected her at least 5 times per period - do you know how often she says Wait, that's wrong... or Where was I again?"
203,"She is extremely confusing, and does not listen to her students. Everytime we ask her to clarify something she walks away and does not answer."
237,"shes nice and all, but if you ask a question she'll either not explain it the way you asked or she'll just completely ignore you."
271,Very unclear teacher. Asks if you have questions then if you actually ask her something she will get mad and say the answer is simple or just tell you to ask a neighbor. I was lucky to escape with a B in both semesters.
305,"She is so mean to you if you ask a question, she never gives you a straight answer and makes you feel stupid for trying to learn."
339,"worst teacher ever, she misunderstands questions u ask and then yells at u about her misunderstanding and then doesn't answer the question."
373,"She has her own answers to every question she asks you, even the opinionated questions. If your opinion doesn't click with her views it's wrong."
407,tells you what to do then denies that she said anything later and gives you a bad grade because she doesnt like what you did even if she told you to do it. dont ask her anything
441,She is very rude. She rarely helps when you ask for it. If you ask her an intelligent question she will respond in a stupid way. No one likes her.
475,"I am suprised she was ranked as high as she is, sh doesn't help us at all, and makes us find out answers on our own when she could just tell us the answers"
509,"She avoided my questions, and kept going on and on about how she can't read our mind because nobody was going to ask her questions because she never answered them...."
543,"He is not very helpful and will tell you to ""look at the book"" 9 times out of 10. Avoid listening to the lectures, as he does not test anything from them and they will only confuse you for the test."
577,"Isnt clear, walks away when you ask a question, and basically doesn't know anything. misses lots of school"
611,Doesn't know how to answer questions or explain things. You get much more from just reading the book than from listening to her.
645,Very unhelpful. Many times when asked questions will not even acknowledge that she heard the question and will look the other way.
679,"she is not helpful, if you ask a question about anything she tells you the answer with more words you dont know, and takes off tons of points for nothing at all"
713,"Ms.clum does not call on anyboady, and if she does she does not answer the question. She will also lie about you if she does not like you."
747,"Mrs.Brown does not know how to control her class. When I ask a question she simply doesn't know the answer, or will make something up that could sound right."
781,"u don't help us out when we don't understand. Also, if we ask a question you make us feel stupid, because sometimes it's an obvious question."
815,"I asked her a legitimate question about a problem from the quiz, and she rolled her eyes and said ""uhh....no......moving on...."". And I was like ""wt*?."" And then I asked Mr. Beilin about the problem and he said that I was right and she was wrong. So basically, she seems to think she is always right, and she does not respect all her students."
849,"She isn't very helpful one day I was absent and asked what I missed but she said ""You shouldn't be asking me."" If you can't ask the teacher then who can you ask"
883,i agree with the other he is no help. you ask him someting and his answer is something about surfing..whats that about?
917,"all you do is read pages from the textbook and highlight things, and if you ask a question she either doesn't answer or restates something that doesn't anwser the question"
951,dislike her very much...shes not helpful at all.. i've had to go to different counselors to get help cause phillipa isnt helpful at ALL
985,She doesnt finish her sentences and never tells us exactly what she wants and then just comes up with stuff to give for the test
1019,"She doesn't like when i ask questions, and when i go for extra help i have to have a specific question."
1053,She always yells at students when they get the problem wrong on the board when she calls you up there to work a problem. Doesn't offer help to students.
1087,I asked her what I was missing in there and she didnt tell me. Teachers are supposed to teach and help not flat out ignore you!
1121,"Do something bad; he stares at you. If you want even more attention, he might even notice you. Do something beyond offensive, and then you might get yourself a referral to Village School. But whatever it is you always say no when they refer you. Then when you say no, they have a puzzled look on t"
1155,Was always rude to me and was only nice to the popular boys. Always made us refer to the google classroom instead of helping me hands-on.
1189,she lieks to make students feel stupid and you have to go after school to get help and then she tells you she cant help you now!
1223,"This guy NEVER knew what he was doing. Most of the time, it was just him up on the board trying to figure out 1 problem. At least he gave away all the answers."
1257,"Whenever you ask her a question, she answers with another completly unhelpful question. Her tests are unreasonably hard whileshe does not teach us the subjects and constantly makes mistakes."
1291,"Says no answer is the wrong answer, but then when you give your opinion he says ""no you're wrong"". also a pretty useless, didn't learn anything worthwhile."
1325,"Whenever I go to his office, he's either never there, or he's busy talking to a student. If he is talking to a student, I'd wait, as time goes on, he completely ignores my presence that I'm there looking for help. I can wait 20 minutes, it doesn't matter, he'd not bother to help or even ask me what I'm doing there."
1359,"Ms. Chan is confusing and ambiguous with her answers to student's questions. She contradicts herself when she explains things to the class. She doesn't know what she is teaching. She is too strict. I was 10 seconds late to class and she counted me and my homework late. Ms. Chan marks questions wrong on tests that aren't wrong and she will mark one student a question wrong on a test and mark another student the same question right, and they both put the same answer (its multiple choice!)"
1393,I have never met someone so into themselves as this man is. Get over yourself! If you're not a football player he won't even glance your way.
1427,oh! she always talks while your doing projects!!! (DUH! stop asking me to repeat everything...........JUST LISTEN!!)
1461,"very intimidating. if you need any sort of help and you ask Mrs. Turlington for experience, she'll tell you that you should have listened even if you did listen and tell you that it's obvious."
1495,doesnt know how to teach and raised my hands a lot and she never answers. she's not that funny either.
1529,You say you have taught us something but you haven't and when we ask for help you say look in your notes. You give us test where we don't know half the stuff on
1563,"I will admit that she tries, but that is not enough because she really doesn't understand algebra herself. Plus she told us that the book was wrong."
1597,no she dont help you or try to help you at all she accuses you for everything and you didnt do nothin she just says that cause she dont like you
1631,Mrs.Beach most of time can't give us answers to our questons.We ask her something and she goes off onto something else.Instead of knowing the material she has to go back in the book to check what we are doing.She does not know how the program works. Harry
1665,"She is very untrustworthy. Does NOT follow through with her word and will tell you what ever you want to make you happy, even if she doesn't plan on backing it up."
1699,"ADVISE!!!! On all those questions he gives u from the book just make up stuff he doesnt grade them he just checks u wrote something, trust me, try it sometime"
1732,"He said that if you do the homework, you would not have problem take test. that is not true"
1766,Not a good teacher. Good luck if you have him. He never helps so just listen to instructions very carefully.
1800,"...""(I ask a question concerning the book)"" ""(He tells me to tell someone who cares)""...He's the worst teacher I have ever had."
1834,She doesn't answer questions when you ask her and she doesn't explain anything. She only gives notes.
1868,"She's awful. She doesn't explain her assignments at ALL. Even if the entire class is confused and asks questions, she won't answer clearly and will later tell us that she was clear and we're wrong. Sh"
1902,"I think her problem is that she doesn't help you, she just tells you what you should do, then does it for you. and she teaches the wrong subject matter."
1936,"I needed help from her during luch at times and when I entered the room she would say ""Come back tomorrow"""
1970,He is alright I guess....he doesnt know how to teach some things and he won't help you when you ask him too. He just tells you to figure it out... =S
2004,"She talks to you like you're an unintelligent 3 year old! Sometimes you'll send her an e-mail and she doesn't respond. Other times, she does respond, but doesn't help much or doesn't give you accurate"
2038,MR. WARLING'S CLASS IS CONFUSING! THERE'S NEVER TIME FOR EXAMPLES AND HE IS ALWAYS PICKING ON THE SAME PEOPLE AND USUALLY THEY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS!
2072,"His favorite phrase is ""no."" It's practically impossible to learn from your mistakes because he refuses to go something on a test with you (or just refuses to give you the test back entirely!)"
2106,"this guy doesn't help at all. whenever i tried to ask him a question, he would just answer me by giving me more questions. he doesnt teach us stuff we need to know for the tests"
2140,"she likes to argue to much and she never wants to help you she says go for extra help to another teacher, but she is pretty nice."
2174,"She's not too clear and does not make logical decisions and when she tells you to do something that doesn't concern you, she says ""cause she said so. Overall bad teacher."
2208,Mr. Hammond tries to help us but often falls short. He rambles on and on and i dontt hink that he has a clue what he is talking about sometimes.
2242,"she is demeaning, and she makes fun of us way too much. She is always saying 'Jesus Christ' or telling us we will never get into college. she sux."
2276,She is very confusing. I will never choose her as my teacher again.~Vesper One
2310,"Ms. Anders is very nice, but she has problems teaching class. She usually corrects test wrong. When I asked her a question, she went, ""I don't know."""
2344,"Mrs. Comparato might be good for someone, but I'd wager and say that about 90% of her students have many issues with her she is very difficult and will not answer simple questions if your an inquisitive person she is not the right fit for you"
2378,one word. intimadating. how does she expect kids to ask questions when she doesnt look like she wants to answer them.
2412,She has to be constantly corrected when she is trying to teach a new subject and expects you to understand it right away . Constantly she had to go back and change something because she mis worked the problem or she did something wrong .
2446,She is so confusing. She picks favorites. She wouldn't talk to my parents about getting my grade up. She said she never had this talk with parent so she won't now. Never helps you if you try to get help
2480,"She is terrible at teaching. She flipps out whenever you ask a question about something you dont know, she thinks your dumb"
2514,We were doing a project and he would come by time to time and look over and tell us what to do. The next day he came by and said it was all wrong???Idoit!
2548,"ms king is a bad teacher she grades everything out of 150 points and gives minus 5 on each problem wrong, if you forget a sigh or something she gives minus 3 and if you dont show your work correctly even though u got the problem right. she never teaches anything just does what the book says"
2582,She cares about the student but doesn't help them solve there problems. Kristen just does the problem for you and it is no help.

2650,"he is not a good teacher, he is impersonal. whenever i asked for help he would ignore me and never help me. very hard to understand too"
2684,All we do is look @ the overhead the whole time and you can raise your hand for an hour and she still wont answer your question.
2718,i had him for philosophy. biggest problem is whenever he doesnt know the answer to something or has been proven wrong he changes subjects
