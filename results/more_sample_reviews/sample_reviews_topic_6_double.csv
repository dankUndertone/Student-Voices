71,When I was in highschool this teacher mocked a straight-A student in a humiliating and innappropriate manner.
143,Very poor attitude with students. Becomes angry easily and singles out students for mistakes. Loves to condescend. Several parents have had meetings with this person and no changes.
215,She mistakes rigor in her judgment of students with quality in her instructional approach. I think she would be happy not to have to work and the resentment shows.
287,"Terrible teacher, does not care about students, would take off points for no apparent reason. Makes assumptions and has very linear mentality."
359,Offer more eye contact; Don't be so stiff; Be more flexible; And be available to students if they need extra help;
431,I have tried to contact this teacher 3 different times and there has been no response. She refuses to communicate and I am a very unhappy parent.
503,No respect for the kids he teaches. If he was to have passion for what he does and treated his students with respect he would get the respect he so dearly desires
575,This teacher is a u know what! She doesnt care about her students and she is a very rude person! She never helps her students & makes them have low selfesteem!
647,"horrible teacher, prefers native speakers over others and commonly accuses non-native speakers of cheating because she doesn't believe in their capability."
719,Ms. Stubbs is a insufficent teacher and is not capable of creating a safe and caring environment for the students she teaches. Please do not get the idea I don't respect her because the state of her
791,takes an immature approach to teaching. suggests that respect between a student and teacher MUST me mutual or else she won't be respectful (role model??)
863,"As a parent I feel that Ms. Alemany should choose another profession. She is inadequate as a teacher, who does not care about her students."
935,I will not allow my child to ever be to placed under the authority of this teacher again! The experience was less than pleasant.
1007,This is the only teacher my child has ever had an issue with in 11 years of schooling. She has zero compassion for students and their personal circumstances. She is unwilling to adjust her approach to a way that child might learn more effectively. My child and I have both reached out to her to try and get my child the extra help to succeed and she refused. This teacher marks assignments as zeros for my child when they are complete & correct because she assumes they aren't before checking.
1079,"This teacher isn't very explanitory, and he isn't my favorite, and he has a little temper, but I can deal with him."
1151,Janet Payne has no tolerance for less than perfect children. She uses harsh words shouted in their ears and belittles infront of the other children. Unless your child is stellar in the classroom bewar
1223,completely unprofessional and talks down to students. I have witnessed her insulting students for not understanding concepts and degrading them. cannot wait to transfer out of her class!
1295,"Very unhelpful, makes students do everything on their own with little support, believes they should do everything themselves."
1367,"very rude, ignorant to students and parents , even those of good students,she has destroyed the intangible spirit at GHS, which is terrible as she was a GHS graduate."
1439,Fred is a knowledgeable teacher but is not helpful or clear in his instructions and meetings.
1511,"Mr. Kattula is unkind and unresourceful. He often misunderstands students. For example, if a child asks his peers for the date, he thinks that the student is distracting the class!"
1583,I am very unhappy with the lack of professionalism here by the faculty nd the things they say. (Especially this one)
1655,"I feel that Joan is very two-faced. She is for the teachers when teachers come to her, but at the same time she's for the parents just as much. I think that St. Agatha would benefit more without her"
1727,"My child comes home every day, in tears, bawling on my shoulder. Carol Ward is an awful teacher, with no respect for her students. The homework they are required to complete each night, in such little time, with no explanation of how to do so, is unbelievably unacceptable. This problem should be resolved VERY soon."
1799,I think mrs. Bollinger has a contract with ICC to send as many students as possible. She isn't very helpful and doesn't really do her job as counselor
1871,"Mrs Yetto has turned more students off to music than she will ever inspire. She uses bullying and fear tactics as instuments of ""education"". She does not provide substantive instruction or materials."
1943,she never treats any teacher with respect. She barges into the class room demands that we listen to her.
2015,Certainly one of the best teachers Westlake has to offer. If you want your child to have a great kindergarten experience I recommend him!
2086,A horrible role model. His 'firey' attitude is just a way of saying he is angry. Makes horribly prejudice remarks and is a throwback to a different era.
2158,She cares to much about sports and does not recognize excelling students but rather those who bring home sports trophies.
2230,Argumentative and sarcastic with students in class. She damaged my son's self esteem and confidence in language skills. He was formerly an A student in all of his spanish classes.
2302,she doesn't respect students so she doesn't get respect back also she doesn't care about teaching anyone
2374,He calls students out if they are not doing well. Isn't very helpful. Gives out way too much homework
2446,He was condescending to the students. At one point verbally abusive to a student to the point the student withdrew from the class. At the end of the semester most of the students had withdrawn. The principal defended him even though there was evidence of the verbal abuse (statements from other students). I would recommend him for no teaching job.
2518,"She will lie to make herself look good in any situation. She does not care about others, only herself."
2590,you need to be more considerate of your students treat us with some respect then maybe students will like you!
2662,This teacher is very rude to her students. I regret having this class and doesn't care when she loses her student's work.
2734,"I'm a Parent of an Honor student.. my son didn't tell me until the the end of the year that Mr. Arroyo's teachings were slightly unethical.. his constant taunts and sarcasm towards his students were very insulting and undermining.. at first I said to my son,maybe it's you being too sensitive, but after speaking to several other parents they agreed and were so dissatisfied with the way he taught. He would tease, taunt and sometimes make fun of his students. he's only nice to his baseball team.."
2806,"She has too much emotional baggage with her. Her boyfriend is married and she talks about him all the time. It's really quite sad. I enjoy teachers who serve as role models and help guide me. Obviously, I'll refrain from seeking her mentorship."
2878,"Verbal and written communications sent home to parents are extremely condescending. Never had a problem with my kid enjoying school until her. I've never met a teacher so rude and talks down to parents if things are not done her way. Everyday my kid comes home I hear stories of how Garcia has yelled at them and made the entire class run for ""talking"". The environment for children especially small children should be warm and welcoming not hostile. In a nutshell no I would not recommend her."
2950,She is not cooperative with students. She is rigid and does give time to students. I got very bad impression of her.
3022,"she is friendly to popular kids, and helps them more than she should, while ignoring her own students."
3094,A bitter vindictive woman who should have EVER gone into teaching if she had any respect for the quality of education at AHS.
3166,She is not meant to be a principal. She does not know how to deal with certain situations at all. When students try to express themselves to her she does not try to hear it. Instead she makes assumptions and does not give the right information. I believe she is not eligible to be dealing with students our age.
3238,"Mr.Rollins is a very uncaring person who does not keep his political views to himself, which causes him to be a very unlikeable teacher"
3310,"Very rude, does not like kids, especially her students(unless they are a cheerleader), never available for a conference with a parent or a student when she says she will be. NO HELP what-so-ever when students ask for it, as a parent if you try to ask all you get is an attitude. Good luck to anyone who gets her as a teacher, I am truly sorry for you and your child."
3382,Very Unfair teacher to his students and does not care about how his students feel
3454,Not helpful. She is too caught up into her social life. Doesn't care about her students. Learn how to teach and show compasssion toward us.
3526,"As a parent, I'm frustrated that my daughter is not enjoying her French because of ms Coldiron. I spoke to other parents and they have the same problem. Are there any changes that am be made which can enhance my students learning for the better?"
3598,"unkind, disrespectful, unhelpful, boring, upsetting, makes other stressful, ALWAYS has to stay on time and can NEVER be flexible"
3670,Madame Willis is nosy and unnecessarily personal with her students. She is very unprofessional and snobby.
3742,"Dr. Joe Gilhaus works for the district office now. He has made a new transfer policy in which is unfair to students in the Shawnee mission district. This man doesn't have any respect for children, and he certainly does not have what it takes to be a teacher."
3814,"My child's experience with Ms. Peterson was very bad to say the least. Ms. Peterson is known for poor attendance, extreme favoritism, and unfair treatment. She's rarely in class, usually missing 2 and sometimes even 3 days a week. She has a group of students she regards as her favorites, and these students are often treated much more leniently and have more privileges than their fellow classmates. My child, and those of other parents, have encountered many problems because of these issues."
3886,Unimpressive as an educator. More worried about himself and his outside interests. He does not care about students and is just going through the motions. School district does not care -- too many bad teachers like this.
3958,Lauren Otero is now an admin at A P Leto High School. If she truly wants to advance in her career she should not make snap judgements. Getting to know the students and the areas in which you have been
4030,My child was never happy in her class and complained of many instances where she treats the kids unfairly. She has no compassion for the kids in class and is plain rude to them most of the times.
4102,Worst teacher I've ever had. She puts students down and never offers constructive criticism.
4173,"it is very obvious that dr. birch favors certain students over others, and if you are unfortunate enough to be one of those she does not favor, she could not care less about you."
4245,"She expects far too much from her students, and criticizes her students if they do something wrong; causing students to constantly feel vulnerable and unstable. Although she provides resources, she lacks knowledge of actually teaching her students something. Depending on her mood, she may ignore a student in need of help, and target them in class."
4317,Terrible principal! Doesn't help the students when they need it. The vice principal does more work then her!
4389,i don't like her... she doesn't teach properly and call parents for no apparent reason. my mother and other mothers have had to talk to her and the principal about her behavior
4461,"As a parent, we dis-liked Ms Palumbo, at her previous school Desert Vista, she was considered rude and unhelpful. As parents we met with Deot head/Asst Princpal to complain and eventually they listened and she was fired in May 2012. She is rude to parents, dismissive and intolerant, to pupils she was mean and divisive. She seems to live through NatLatin League and uses it to forward herself at the expense of students, Oh Seton Catholic, you don't know what you have done hiring her!"
4533,She never seemed to care about me or any other student. It was all about doing her job and in the end she never was much help.
4605,I would hardly call him a teacher. He listens to the same music every day during class and tells his students that they are not allowed to ask him for help. Disgrace to his profession.
4677,Very unprofessional. Degrades and embarasses students in class. Knows what she is talking about in math but very narrow minded and unhappy and unwilling to help. i can think of one word to describe he
4749,"Mrs. Back is one of the few teachers that I have absolutely no respect for. She has no respect for her students, and deserves none in return."
4821,she's the laziest teacher ever. she recycles her lessons over and over again. she will not detour from them regardless of her students struggling or not. I would suggest taking Spanish instead.
4893,She didn't acknowledge that some students may need extra help or extra clarification- I came in as a straight A's student and walked out with a C.. good luck.
4965,"Unhelpful, unclear, and doesn't treat people with respect. Self-centered, and egotistical! Not very knowledgeable either!"
5037,Horrible. Experience. Did not grade properly. Blames fault on students and doesn't take blame for his own mistakes. Bad guy
5109,His character is not one that I want to have my child around. He has proven himself to be manipulative and untrustworthy. I do not recommend that anyone allow him to teach their child.
5181,"She is rather rude to certain parents whose children are core(zone) students, and very nice to parents whose children are magnet students.She's helpful if you are not hispanic or black,not a good person to be in her position, you have to treat all children the same fairness goes a long way,people tend to notice the difference quickly.Magnet parents are treated like GOLD and Core (ZONE KIDS) need I have to spell it out , it is without a doubt different in treatment at this school."
5253,The admissions packet sent to perspective students states that the students think highly of their teachers.(Ameisen) That publication does not relect what we students think of her.
5325,"mr bushee is one of the rudest, most cruel teachers i have ever had! he derives fun from making fun of his students! its also nearly impossible to get an 'A' in his class. dont take him, take Mr Lee!"
5397,DOES NOT TEACH. Assigns independent units to avoid doing any work herself. She constantly criticizes students and does not offer any real help. WORST teacher I have ever had.
5469,"if the average score on a test is an F and the high score is a C, isn't that a sign it's the teacher's fault and not the students'?"
5541,"Very rude, disrespectful, abusive, doesn't listen or help. Doesn't care if you understand, even though he says he does"
5613,"Tends to think students are wrong at everything, is extremely critical of student's writing, and tends to pick favorites. Nice guy, but he needs some work."
5685,She has the potential to be a really good teacher but at least in my experience she was rude and unhelpful when anyone tried to ask questions.
5757,"Cindy Riordan clearly mixes politics with her take on the education system. She teaches and grades her students from a bias perspective based on the parents' politcal affiliations and views, that are generally reflected in their children. She will punish a student and more harshly grade their work if she senses a parent is not on her side of the political spectrum."
