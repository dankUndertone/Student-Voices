83,Assigns a hard project that you have to complete on top of a mountain of homework IN ONE DAY!
167,"He is such a slow grader. He still hasn't graded essays from a month ago, even though he has had plenty of time over the numerous breaks."
251,"She is one of the worst teachers ever. She gives us a bunch of useless papers, and makes you do stuff and then never collects it. If you want to get a good grade add random color to everything."
335,"Hes so hard, all his work is muti projects. so its a bunch of little projects all combined together. Olny thing is the projects arent little."
418,"mrs. dawson is one of the most unclear teachers that i have ever had, the work is scetchy and the worksheets are pointless, THEY MAKE NO SENSE!!!"
502,You always change your mind about due dates for projects and papers at the last minute. Your class was very easy tho even though you gave me 4 or 5 zeros
586,Doesn't explain very well. Just gives a lot of work & homework on weekends. She does give extra credit work though.
670,Inconsistent w/instructions...gives last minute instructions on 9 wk projects when students have completed or nearly completed them...does not tell each class the same instructions...grades harshly & inconsistently
753,She gives us too much homework. She tells us two weeks before it is due and than she never tells us again.
837,she doesn't tell you things and then punishes you for not following the directions she never gave you. and she loses a lot of the paperwork...very strict...: /
921,Never gets the work back in a reasonable amount of time. Does she even grade the work when she first gets it?
1005,He is the worst. He revoked the grades that he had given me beforee multiple times. He also changed the grading system while we were taking a test. He said we wouldnt have finals but now he says we do hes the wrostarre
1088,"Not clear on assignments, disorganized and waits till last minute to enters grades, which she always messes up. Stay on top of her to make sure you get the grade you deserve. Also she puts material on tests that was never covered and expects you to know it."
1172,Lazy Teacher that gives little or no direction. Just gives out work sheets and sits are her desk and texts all day.
1256,He only likes his Publications class! Not clear on some assignments and don't give us enough time. Grades thinks wierdly. Ex: grades by how much you finish. He should just tell us to do something and give us a due date instead of cutting the assignment up into little pieces and grading it by little sections.
1340,she never hands back papers she is not only inconsitent but she is contradictory she does give extensions but rarely explains what should be doneHORRIBLE TEACHE
1423,Gives 6wks projects 1 wk before due. she requires a 6PG Report in less than 1 wk but we can only do it if we have the books we cant get take from the library.
1507,you were a very unorganized teacher you never checked the advanced classes homework but never seemed to forget to check anyother classes homework
1591,"i do not like this teacher,she always naggs and complains and doesn't check or give back homework,and gives unfair quizzes."
1675,"his tests r so hard. he has da worst policy of never changing a grade once you get it back, even if it is his fault.what is 3*4, but he took off 13 points"
1758,she is a horrible teacher i suggest u do ur homework she gives u homework every single dayy !!!!!! u will deffiently want ms binder for ur 7th grade math teacher ms binder is the bomb.com
1842,"Never updates skyward until after the trimester if at all. Just a lazy teacher who by the way, is as unathletic as ever."
1926,Very unorganized and can be unclear on directions. Does not know how to grade hw. Has a weird grading system and does not allow make ups on assignments. Transfer out if you get her
2010,She couldn't keep up with the assignments and the grades and didn't prepare us for our exam. I don't know what grade I ended up with in that class because she never updated edline.
2093,"I liked mr goodling as a person and when he taught us. What I didn't like about him is that he never followed through with any assignments and never graded anything, especially when we all worked really hard on it and he made a big deal out of the projects. He never even handed back our I-Search or Romeo and Juliet projects. Plus we read To Kill A Mockingbird for absolutely no reason other than to talk all the time. Most of his assignments are pointless and never graded."
2177,"Clearly overwhelmed by modern classroom requirements. Unable to keep up with online grades or assignments. Fails to grade student assignments by the end of grading periods and ignores them. If, as a parent, you ask about a grade, she'll tell you about how many pieces of paper she has to grade everyday. I get it, it is hard. By not grading assignments she earns an F just like a student would if they did not turn in an assignment. Abrupt with students, parents and administration."
2261,He doesnt make any sense.. Doesnt have a lesson plan.. His class is just a mess.. they do different things every day and gives homework that doesnt relate to the lesson.
2345,"shes kinda cool but she takes hw assignments as test grades. she was like ""if its not your best work dont turn it in"" to defend herself. i got a C on that ""test"""
2428,She is easy once you learn how she grades. She hardly ever gives tests but she grades tough on projects. Make sure you get good grades on the portfolios. Very unclear/
2512,"mrs lynn doesnt realize we have other periods and gives too much work, she yells at us when we ask a question and is almost impossible to work with"
2596,"Her class was difficult for me. She never taught us about writing, just handed out essay prompts and then handed them back with a score. We accomplished very little in the class."
2680,"Sporadically assigns unclear homework assignments, often contrary to those printed in her homework calendar. Yells at the entire class over trivial matters, which wastes time."
2763,I HATE Ms.Hoppie so much I can't stand her accent and she gives the dumbest work ever. I pay so much attention in her class i get 100's on all my tests and homework and she gives me a 90 for a quarter average. :P
2847,This woman is possibly the most insipid person I have met. Her homework is pointless. I have a hard time just getting through the instructions.
2931,"Really strict, makes sure you're totally organized. He goes off-topic a lot. Gives a lot of homework."
3015,unhelpful and forgetful. he is very slow on getting back to you if you ask him to investigate something. waits to update edline until you get a bad grade. save yourself and opt out of his class now!
3098,"if ur in algebra shes REALLY hard, homework everday and tests everyother week. if ur in math 8, u have homework once a week and rarely tests. very hard teacher!!"
3182,She sucks as a teacher she will give you a low grade for you work and tell you is wrong but she is so unclear
3266,does not explain subject well. Needs to be more detailed in what assignments she gives. Tell the students if their project is worth 55% of their grade!.
3350,Gives way to much homework at some times and none at other. NO balance at all. Though she is nice to talk to. Test are hard and some of the work is hard to understand.
3433,Ms. Goswami doesn't teach at ALL. She gives you worksheets at you do it the whole period. She collects your work at the end of class; but she may lose your work the next week.
3517,He gives to much homework waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
3601,"Mrs.Aliberto hasn't put a grade in for me in several weeks and the grading period is ending, so I have no clue what my grade is. Her assignments are confusing and useless and she always let's her students distract her, thus getting nothing done."
3685,All Mr. Mansour does is pick favorites and gives pointless assignments with almost always no due dates on any of them. Definitley one of my least favorite classes.
3768,Why is there no option for a lot of homework? This lady gives toooooo much work.
3852,Unorganized. Loses papers. Insane! Will go on rampages. Get him talking about something else and you won't have homework.
3936,"Always loses your work, and when you continue to give in copies she ignores them then at the end of the quarter puts in all F's for everything she's too lazy to grade always drooling on her computer."
4020,"Teacher makes own impression instead of class work. Even you can do very well on exam, classwork, homework. He will give you grade according his own rule. He makes participation more than everything else. Even you participate more than others, he will only make his own, not by fact."
4103,"She totally makes up all her lessons, and never collects the random busywork she gives us. NOT at ALL a good teacher."
4187,"Very hard to understand her, she will give labs and not go over them and tell you what to do in them. To be honest I think she is kind of lazy"
4271,"She doesnt teach, she just is cranky. She needs grades so she gives us bookwork and tells us to write long papers without telling us what it means. I mean we had to do a worksheet on GoodBurger."
4355,she is not too bright... she has had people doing home work in her class and she doeswnt realize it... people can even show her the same home work every single day and she will give you the points
4439,"He doesn't help anyone. He doesn't help with the work that he gives you. When he checks homework, he says ""Excellente"" and then gives you a 70! How is that good"
4522,Mitchell is ok...she can sometimes give meaningless work. She gives a lot of projects but overall she is pretty nice and she soes move back work if you ask her to.
4606,"She assigns way too much homework, most of the time its random busy work that does not relate to anything we learn in class. I wish she would stop treating her students as is we were infants. We do have some common sense, we did make it to Oxford!! One of the most annoying things about her is that she assigns different homework assignments for different periods. She is a confusing teacher who assigns so much homework that she even cant keep up with it. She could be less strict about late work!!"
4690,"I don't like her. First week of school and we have a massive essay that we're expected to have done over the weekend, and know how to do citations perfectly. I hate her."
4774,"Ms Murphy has taken weeks off, and when she comes back to school, she assigns a quiz or test on curriculum we haven't even heard about yet. On top of that, she has a tendency to give plenty of zeros on homework, and yell it kids a lot."
4857,"My biggest complaint about this teacher is that his teaching style and grading scale do not go well together at all. He grades things based off of a 4 point scale but uses these extremely skewed grading rubrics he pulls off the internet for his assessments. These assessments are 90% of his class meaning no one puts any effort into what he has to say unless its another test, so most of the class period is him talking to himself about an assignment no one will do. He should teach with his own work"
4941,Ashley can be mean and rarely is nice. Depending on her mood she gives a lot of homework or a little homework. She has no tolerance for anyone.
5025,Really sorry doesn't make things cleart and just assign us homework and then doesnt properly go over it then assign test and expects us to know it!!!!!
5109,"Mrs Snow is an awful teacher! she has too many favorites, and also has a few certain people she hates. She is unclear and never checks homework - she's so irresponsible!"
5192,Mrs. Randle never teaches anything and expects you to know everything. She delays all projects until the last six weeks and doesn't tell you how to do them.
5276,You are so mean and u will give us so much homework and i don't like the way you always give us textbook homework like every single day!
5360,You send me to bic every week and all your assignments bore me to tears.You assign way too much homework! WE GO TO SCHOOL FOR 7 HOURS 5 DAYS A WEEK AND THEN HAVE TO GO HOME AND DO MORE WORK! Its like u dont think we have a life after school.
5444,She confuses herself in class and will get mad at you for proving her wrong. I would not recommend taking her class your grade is based on a group paper and whatever she feels like that day.
5527,It was hard to care about this class. I have no idea how he graded us because we never got any scores on projects or anything back. He is disorganized so definitely don't expect a progress report.
5611,"I took AP US History and it was very clear that he graded with bias. He consistently gave me low essay grades even though I usually score pretty high in english/history classes. He gave some of my friends higher essay grades even though I usually get higher grades than them. I ultimately got a 4 on the AP exam while the people he graded higher got 2s. He read off slides the entire class, which was incredibly dull and the only reason I did well on the AP exam was crash course."
5695,She is very nice. I always feel like I understand what she tells us. However- she doesn't even mention about 75% of what will be on her tests. She gives enough fluff grades that the class isn't too too hard though.
5779,Completely biased. Gives out arbitrary grades on assignments with no standards. Discriminates against one class in favor of the other. So glad I graduated and don't see him anymore.
5862,Can you say bussy work? OMG she asigned more homework projects a week than most teachers do in a year. I cant believe she still gets paid.
5946,Very intelligent however she cannot relay her the information to her students successfully. Also is extremely forgetful. She forget to give me needed homework when I reminded her 4-5 times
6030,Assigns lots of busy work assignments. Here grading expectations are too high for high school students. Is not very understanding of the student's needs or extra curricular activities. She makes the class very hard to enjoy coming to.
6114,It is impossible to get higher than a C+ in his class. I guess the reason why is because I don't throw back his own opinions on his own test. Is this the point of Theology?
6197,You know how teachers give you busy work? He gives it to you and then doesn't grade it. You basically get an A in that class for showing up.
6281,Taking Comp Civics was a big mistake. My other grades are ruined thanks to his unreasonable expectations.
6365,"Smart guy but awful teacher, didnt even grade my sophomore research paper which we worked on for 3 months"
6449,"If you are a guy in her class she will hate you. If you put even slightly gender-biased language in papers such as ""mankind,"" instead of ""human-kind"" you will receive an automatic letter-grade drop."
6532,Teaches nothing. Hard to understand. You don't learn you get more confused. Your better off signing up for khan academy and learning from them instead. Gives you notice of a quiz the day its given. Gives packets and puts grades in extremely late so your grade stays low if you got one bad grade. Worst Teacher Ever.
6616,i dont like her at all. she doesn't teach anything in class and gives us way too many useless sheets of paper
6700,one of the hardest essay graders I have ever met. Her vocab tests and quizzes are impossible. The work load is an okay amount and she iis nice to you if she likes you...
