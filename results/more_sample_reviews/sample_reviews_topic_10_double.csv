50,She gets triggered when you ask her for help. I most definitely do not recommend her
101,she doesn't help us at all and when u ask her a question she doesn't want to help and she doesn't let u correct her because she thinks she is always right even when she isn't and she doesn't let us go
152,"does not explain anything and when you raise your hand she never calls on you, even if it is an important question."
203,"She is extremely confusing, and does not listen to her students. Everytime we ask her to clarify something she walks away and does not answer."
254,"She says she will help you when you're with a class, but she doesn't. She'll say that she'll help you in a minute and never does. She's never in the library either. ???"
305,"She is so mean to you if you ask a question, she never gives you a straight answer and makes you feel stupid for trying to learn."
356,Does not answer any of your questions. When you do have questions she will not fully answer them.
407,tells you what to do then denies that she said anything later and gives you a bad grade because she doesnt like what you did even if she told you to do it. dont ask her anything
458,"The only way to not fail that class, is to not listen to what she says. Everytime i listen, i get confused. When i dont listen, i do fine and get A's."
509,"She avoided my questions, and kept going on and on about how she can't read our mind because nobody was going to ask her questions because she never answered them...."
560,"If you play a sport, you'll get at least a B and she'll help you out all she can whenever you like. Don't play a sport? No help, she's too busy."
611,Doesn't know how to answer questions or explain things. You get much more from just reading the book than from listening to her.

815,"I asked her a legitimate question about a problem from the quiz, and she rolled her eyes and said ""uhh....no......moving on...."". And I was like ""wt*?."" And then I asked Mr. Beilin about the problem and he said that I was right and she was wrong. So basically, she seems to think she is always right, and she does not respect all her students."
866,"She is REALLY irritating and shows way too much favoritism. For example, if we are going over a multiple choice question as a class, she would choose the wrong answer choice and try to convince us it's right. When we start arguing with her she checks the question and it turns out SHE was wrong. Also, whenever you ask her a question she ALWAYS has to ask the other teachers and never gets back to you on it."

1172,you dont know what your doing cause you always geta questions rong..and you never explain what we have to do good !
1223,"This guy NEVER knew what he was doing. Most of the time, it was just him up on the board trying to figure out 1 problem. At least he gave away all the answers."
1274,"At times, ignores students. VERY UNCLEAR. Must ask questions numerous times to get a clear response. Yet very laid back."
1325,"Whenever I go to his office, he's either never there, or he's busy talking to a student. If he is talking to a student, I'd wait, as time goes on, he completely ignores my presence that I'm there looking for help. I can wait 20 minutes, it doesn't matter, he'd not bother to help or even ask me what I'm doing there."

1732,"He said that if you do the homework, you would not have problem take test. that is not true"
1783,Sometimes she's just a not helpful at all jerk. Like you ask her something she's supposed to know and acts like you're just a moron for asking her...very mean at times!
1834,She doesn't answer questions when you ask her and she doesn't explain anything. She only gives notes.

2344,"Mrs. Comparato might be good for someone, but I'd wager and say that about 90% of her students have many issues with her she is very difficult and will not answer simple questions if your an inquisitive person she is not the right fit for you"
2395,"She is always lost, does not do what she says she will and never helps you if you don't understand. She also always interrupts the class randomly when we are working and wastes our time."
2446,She is so confusing. She picks favorites. She wouldn't talk to my parents about getting my grade up. She said she never had this talk with parent so she won't now. Never helps you if you try to get help

2905,she doesnt know how to teach...she wont help you and if she does she just yells at you if you dont understand it or get it wrong!
2956,"Sergio is a miserable teacher. He gives unclear directions and homework, quizzes with things that we never learned and doesn't help. One time on a quiz for number 1, I got C for the correct answer and he marked it correctly. My partner also got C for 1 but he marked it wrong... Another time he marked a conjugation wrong that was right and I spent 10 minutes tying to figure out what was wrong, then I asked him and he said, ""Oh its fine."" If you get Sergio, drop his class while you can."

3058,"She is something else... I had her for geometry in 8th Grade. Not much help. She's a good person but really needs to work on her teaching. She will often deny you the right to ask a question saying ""You should have asked earlier"". Overall I do not recommend."

3465,"This teacher truly inflicted suic idal thoughts even though it was only for a second and it was only the irrational part of my concision, so it would have never happened, but that tells you something about the homework she gives you."
3516,"Yells every time you ask for help, does NOT know how to do algebra..she should stick to teaching english"
