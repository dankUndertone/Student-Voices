89,The class would not be that bad if he actually taught and we didn't have to teach the material to ourselves every night.
178,He puts stuff on tests that were never in our notes. I am wondering HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS. i wonder why everyone is failing his class...
267,"If you memorize everything you should be fine but once she gave us a quiz on something we hadn't even studied. Also she goes off on random tangent-lessons that have nothing to do with anything. Nice, but expects too much."
357,Very easy class but don't expect to learn anything. Lots of busy work. May have difficulty on exams because she has not taught what is on it very well.
446,"If you get Mrs. Boyle as an AP government teacher, either switch your class or teach yourself, because you sure aren't gonna get taught anything by her."
535,"Busse expects you to read the chapters he covers, but he won't tell you that. He doesn't teach you everything on the test. Read the book and you will pass his class. Inappropriate and funny. Good guy."
625,He does not explain anything and do not take a class with him. You will be very frusturated because he never knows what he wants.
714,SHE DOES NOT TEACH! She expects us to know everything so we all fail our tests which has nothing on it that she fought us.
803,"she tells her students to go home and take notes, then we come to school and take more notes...she never teaches anything"
892,had her for frosh sci AND h. bio there is no way i will ever take any other class she teaches no matter what
982,I feel that you explain unimportant materials when you teach but then you give us test and its on things you barely covered
1071,"She doesn't help anyone in my class learn and her lessons are repetitive and boring. In her class, we have never done anything except notes and tests."
1160,"don't take an AP class from him. He doesn't teach he just gives you the book and basically tells you to teach yourself. He's a cool guy, but a bad teacher."
1250,"i wish helen vendler was never even born, would have made this class a lot more tolerable. he doesn't prepare you adequately for the AP test and just gives you a lot of busy work. you have to prepare"
1339,"Absolutely horrible. 60% of my class has a failing quiz grade and nobody has an A. Quizzes are completely irrelevant, she doesn't teach anything, and all the projects are stupid, useless, and a waste"
1428,"She ""taught' science, but didn't reallly know any phys sci (just some bio) and didn't care enuf to learn so she could teach us even tho that was part of the req. lessons."
1518,My personal experience that I had was that this was the worst teacher I have ever had. I got a b just barely in her class after 2 hours everyday of studying for her class. The way she teaches is useless. I know people that have a 4.4 gpa and struggled to get a b in her class. For example one week I had 3 quizzes and a test and every study guide she gave you there was no answer key then she would put other randoms stuff on the tests and quizzes that were not on the study guides
1607,"easy class if you're self motivated, she teaches nothing; wait for Coach Tonn next year and he'll teach you what she fails in"
1696,"He doesn't teach his students. He expects all of his students to understand the things he teaches when he doesn't teach it at all. If a student asks a question we walks away and ignores the students question. When he gives a big test he only gives one or two days notice, and no study guide. The test are 80% made up of things he never taught and while the things he did teach are barley on the test."
1785,"Is funny, but not a good teacher. Most students dont pass the AP exam or barely will. Doesn't give you enough information to actually pass the tests. SWITCH OUT."
1875,"He doesn't ever actually teach us, but he expects us to magically know the information. He never goes over homework problems, and he gives tests over things we haven't learned."
1964,those who like her because she never teaches in the class; always off topic; I put on my headphone on for the whole cycle and she never noes; worst teach I had
2053,"didn't teach anything, had terrible subs the entire year and told us to not study for things that were eventually on the ap exams!"
2143,"Not a good teacher, doesn't teach you anything from what will be on tests"
2232,"Not sure if shes a teacher, she doesnt teach during class and you have to learn most of the information on your own, she offers retakes and extra credit for almost every test and assignment because the class average is sub 70% every time. She changes quiz dates often , and without notice, as well as assuming that you know most of the class information coming into the class"
2321,this teacher is not a good teacher. Everyone fails her class and tests.Even though she lets us re-tests she will make it harder and make people fail.She really needs to learn how to teach better. Thx
2410,Ms. Kranik is an overwhelming teacher. She doesn't give us study guides for any of her tests and expects us to know the material. She has an attitude with the entire class and likes to single people out. S
2500,"Honestly she never really ever teaches us anything. She is off topic lecturing about things we don't need and don't care about at all - on and on. She constantly gives us loads of homework everyday, which would make sense if she was teaching us the materials, but she only gives us textbook work. You really wouldn't learn if you didn't read the book. She also brings these awful magazine clippings almost every. She shows us things and lectures us on them when they have nothing to do with the class"
2589,Easy if you memorize his study guides. But your basically on your own. He can't teach for nothing. And it's his way or no way. He hates to be proven wrong.
2678,"doesnt teach very well in class because she cant control her students, so make sure to try to learn the information on your own before tests, because if you fail a test your grade goes wayyy down."
2768,"YEAH WORST TEACHER OF MY LIFE. SHE BASICALLY JUST GIVES YOU THE BOOK AND TELLS YOU TO READ IT AND EVERY TWO WEEKS WE HAVE A TEST. ONLY ONE PERSON IN MY CLASS GOT AN ""A"" AND THAT WAS ME AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I STUDIED LIKE 4 HOURS FOR EVERY TEST AND QUIZ. SHE DOESNT TEACH ANYTHING THE WHOLE YEAR."
2857,All she is about is MLA. She couldn't give a ____ about anything else. Her tests are about the things in a story that DONT matter. Her projects are poorly planned and the expectations aren't well layed out at all.
2946,One of the worst teachers I've ever had he may be easy on homework but when it comes to tests you don't know anything because he doesn't teach you anything. I have not learned one thing in his class and he is just not a good teacher at all.
3036,"Please do not take that teacher. he is no help for his students, he doesn't give any study guides to help at tests, his exam are horrible it's like nothing you study are on the test. he's gonna tell you to buy the online guide don't buy he's making you waste your money, before the semester ends half of the class will drop. His final is from chapter 1 to 15 and he add to more chapters. He expect you to know everything on the book. If you one of the students that cannot study a lot DON'T TAKE HM."
3125,He fails majority of his classes. Almost all people retaking the course at city college through College For Teens are from his class. You won't learn anything that isn't in the book from this teacher.
3214,"Could be such a great class if it wasn't for all the notes she makes you do. She barely teaches and when she does, it's extremely insufficient for tests."
3303,Worst science teacher I've ever had. She never taught us a single thing and it was basically an independent study
3393,"Probably one of the crappiest teachers I have ever had. He doesn't do anything, ever. He just gives us worksheets or other busy work while he just gets on the computer."
3482,He does not teach anything. He talks all class about nonsense and hands crossword with no word bank saying her you go study this you have test. The tests are super hard because we don't learn anything
3571,"Her class is easy. But she DOESNT TEACH. At all, she writes on the board tells you to copy it. And her notes dont go with anything on the tests. TERRIBLE TEACHER."
3661,"He always talks about donuts and bananas. Gets off topic every class, we can't even finish notes. Then he gives a super hard test on stuff that he never taught us."
3750,"The amount of crazy flowing through her brain is at such a huge amount at any time of the day. Not only does her whole entire lesson come from the textbook but you also get tested every week, and some weeks you can even get tested on every single day! This teacher is the reason im not taking spanish next year."
3839,did not teach the class or have any control over her students... exams were difficult especially since she did not teach. she did not hand out note packets and would never clearly explain the lessons. everyone had to study on their own and teach themsleves everything.
3928,"She is by far the worst teacher i've had, first of all she does not teach at all and her tests have nothing to do with what she teaches, she taught us an entire section that was half the final in 2 days. Although she is nice, you do not learn anything in that class."
4018,Wow....worst teacher I ever had...literally. its almost as if he never learned how to teach. make sure u dont get him...u do and ull get a 1 on the AP test
4107,"scribbles a bunch of stuff across the board, which is not easy to copy down for studying, and then exects you to know the minutae of it on the test. bring a tapedeck to tape the class."
4196,"worst teacher i have ever had at rindge!she doesnt teach,and tells the student to read the text book.she doesnt return work,and then expects us to do well on the test.and she doesnt know the material!"
4286,i think mrs. pyle is a bad teacher. she doesn't teach us good lessons and we don't learn much. she expects us just to do the homework and then we will know everything. she should teach the class more and have more control over the classes. she makes it a difficult way of learning and i haven't learned much and failed the tests. i htink she hsould give us review sheets for the tests because most of her students in the class are failing the tests and they're hard without review sheets or good lessons!!
4375,She should just quit. I have been in her class only for 2 days now and she is already giving homework and quizes. Did not review or take any notes. She just gave us notes and expects us to learn it.
4464,"I took APES with him... it was a disaster. All we did was watch movies all year, then closer to the AP exam he deciders to rush and ""teach"" us all the stuff he missed. It's ridiculous. He is lazy and most classes i just sat there with nothing to do. He is a nice guy, but a terrible teacher. You have to teach yourself all of the information."
4554,She helped us with nothing and didnt prepare us for tests also all she did was talk to mrs. Kulish. Overall she was not a good teacher.
4643,"she doesn't prepare you for the Ap exam at all. Gives you months to finish an assignment. Didn't have any tests for the whole year, and she rarely gives out homework. You don't have to try to get an A in her class, but you'll fail the exam if you don't self study."
4732,"has is moments but aside from that he's awful. he just has us write, I don't retain anything!! i have no idea how to study for his final and am going to fail !!! grr i strongly dislike this guy"
4821,She is one of the worst teachers my children have ever had. All she does is give notes and tests.
4911,"dosen't teaches at all, and handouts are not related to topic. dosen't prepare us for tests."
5000,He gives ridiculous homeowork assignments on stuff that we do not learn and he goes on and puts that stuff on the tests
5089,"i had her two years ago and man is she bad at teaching. i didn't learn chemistry at all. i just learned how to put numbers into meaningless formulas. i dont understand why the class is in a lab room because we dont do any labs in that class. we never use the book so dont even bother checking it out. and she doesnt even make the final - she's too lazy to so she steals it from another teacher, and the final is just all this chem stuff that she's never taught or heard of in her life."
5179,All we ever did in that class are labs. She just sits on her stool & goes on her computer. She hardly taught anything.
5268,"she hasn't done anything in that class except have us read boring books,NAG about everything and get mad at us for stuff she hasn't even taught us!!!"
5357,She failed everyone on an exam worth 10% of our grade. Her lectures are unclear and nobody understand what is going on. She has good intentions but is not a good teacher. She sees everything very black and white and makes no acceptions. Her test have no realativity to what she lectures about so everyone fails them.
5446,"He is honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. I really recommend switching to a different teacher if you have him. He will not teach you anything at all, he just gives you packets EVERY SINGLE D"
5536,"I had him last year as my statistics teacher. Very disorganized when it comes to notes and the class is a self study class. Essentially on the night before the test, you have to teach yourself and memorize things because he is terrible at explaining things. Terrible teacher"
5625,"mr. nicsaji is so weird - all we do in class is correct homework! there's so much more stuff we could do w/ our 45 minutes. we don't learn anything, i just pass notes / friends!"
5714,Mr. Stern did not teach my class very well and did not teach what was going to be on the test. He made me dislike science class and I love science.
5804,"nothing is taught, absolutely useless....she gives us work thats not even related to social studies and tells us there is a test a DAY BEFORE the test giving us no time to study"
5893,"I had her for geometry last year and she teaches you nothing. Everything I learned last year I had to teach myself. When you ask her for help she just makes you more confused. She puts stuff you never learned on the tests, and basically gives you the answers when you ask for help on them, even on the final."
5982,"Don't you thing if one of your students was failing every test and quiz and they try so hard in your class that they might, I don't know, NEED HELP IN THE CLASS."
6072,i hate it his class. he is not very helpful on test. if u do not know it then u screwed cause he will not help u.
6161,This women is terrible if u get her drop the class all you will hear about is the gateway she doesnt teach she just constanly reminds you bout the gateway test
6250,"Dr. Anderson is funny but he can not teach.
He is horrible at teaching. I don't learn anything in his class.
The only reason he came to Tech, was to coach the tennis team."
6339,A ton of book work when the study guides have all the test answers in them.
6429,"She is trash. Doesn't know anything about science and relies on worksheets to teach us. Also a lot of useless homework. If you have her, I pray for you."
6518,"Just agree with all of his viewpoints and 'see symbolism' in everything and you'll be fine. If you don't want to do that, it will be harder."
6607,"she gives you a bunch of papers, and doesn't explain them. She expects you to know everything before she even ""teaches"" it. She yells at you for everything, and her test are impossible. taking her honors biology is like taking an AP biology class. Love Loui tho."
6697,"She gives absolutly no partial credit! You want a challenging teacher but she is just about impossible! But, I guess I did learn alot."
6786,"Doesn't teach, complains about people being insecure and complains all the time and gives quizzes over stuff she doesn't teach, and comes in high or with a hangover it seems."
6875,She is the worst teacher i have ever had. She is not up to the standards of teaching an AP/B environmental science class. You will not be prepared for the end of the year AP or IB test. You will have to take the reins for this one.
6965,Would like to switch out of AP and take it with another teacher. He is not preparing us for the exam!
7054,"She has NO idea what she is doing. She doesn't know the curriculum or how to teach. She also cannot control the class. She is so unorganized and never grades anything until the day before the quarter ends. I emailed her a question, and she never replied. Not only is she a bad teacher, she's also very rude. She didnt cover all the material before the exam (even though she teaches from the textbook). My class was 3 weeks behind. Im usually a straight A student, but I have a C in her class."
7143,Not GOOD! packets every day. Dont know when we have tests. Agenda for the day is from a students NB from last year.
