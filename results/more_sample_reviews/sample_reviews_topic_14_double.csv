100,"Mrs Cerling is not a qualified woman to become the dean. Cocord's discipline will be gone, because nobody respects her. Hope they hire a good assistant dean."
150,"Seriously, is he a principal? I think he is just a building developer. He nor the school cares about children. But cares for the money that they bring and will build the new School at UTD."
200,"ego gets the best of him, i had him as a football coach and most of the guys including myself didnt have the best of experiences with him."
250,SO GLAD I WILL NEVER HAVE TO SEE HER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND!!TOO BAD I WONT BE AROUND TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
301,"can't coach worth a penny, doesn't recognize talent even if ronaldo was kicking him...poor work ethic, not qualified,not helpful, not funny, aliens don't exist!"
351,He is too afraid of what other thinks so he is unwilling to make a decision that might go out on a limb and make the school better because someone somewhere might object
401,"Doesn't it seem that she wants to coach the ""winning"" team? Softball, Volleyball and now Basketball? Seems like what Flo wants Flo gets. WAKE UP FHS ADMIN!"
451,"""I can do 100 push ups in 3 minutes and bench press 200 pounds"" Boi, no you can not."
501,A fairly hypocritical principal. She yelled at us for getting up to throw trash away and then yelled at us for not throwing trash away.
551,He doesn't let us bring backpacks into the room and he doesn't move his neck or eyes. He is very stric and his teaching style is odd.
602,She isn't the brighest teacher you have ever seen considering she lock herself out of her house/car in 10 degree weather. She isn't the best teacher ither.
652,Linda you have drove every one good away from that school because how incredibly mean you are and how you cannot work with anyone someone needs to open their eyes its a SIN

752,Just terrible Nurse...She just needs a sniffle to send the kids back home ...Much worse staff roams freely in school and the students are subjected to unfairness and sent home at the slightest excuse..Looks like she is paid to find kids who can be sent home.
802,Ms. Wren has no idea what she is doing! Our school deserves to have a better (or at least more intelligent) principle. She threatened me and should be fired.
852,i personally dont think he is the best teacher or helper in the school. i would prefer to see ms. christy or someone that runs a program at the school take charge. some of my friends also agree that h
903,diver doesnt care about the students or what we think he took away the hat rule just when i was going into my freshman year and he ruined homecoming for everyon
953,He is destroying the school.Many of its best teachers have left because of his decisions. If he doesn't leave soon I'm afraid that their won't be a school left to save.
1003,"If I'm right, one time, someone in my wing jumped out the window, ran around the school, and came back in through the door and she didn't know... or so I heard from a LOT of people..."
1053,Mrs. Fas is a GREAT teacher!!!...when theres a 53.65589574% chance of rain on a dark camel living under a gigantic smiley face.
1103,"It is amazing that this ""Leader of our school"" is such a poor role model; he never smiles! Why not try to actually meet some of us rather then frown at us."
1153,"he does no work, he lets reagan take care of everything. he just chases around people like ryan around all day."
1204,"He should ride the short bus. I do not say this militously, but his first season as football coach, his JV team went 0-10."
1254,Mr. williamson has a hearing problem and his eyes are not too good either as he is unaware of what is going on around him.
1304,"He's taking away all the traditions that we have at Owen. That's totally wrong, especially considering that many of the teachers actully attended school at Owen"
1354,She tries to keep artwork and pretend like another school stole it. She's done this twice to my paintings.
1404,"Coach Ford is about the laziest human being on earth! He never taught a day I was there!! He sat at his computer, doing nothing every day. He doesn't care, because he thinks being a coach is enough. Why do we pay these people to be babysitters?"
1454,Dr. Kramer comes into the school in his first year and thinks he owns the place. he is arrogent and thinks he knows whats best for the school and is changing things that have been in the school for ye
1505,Has driven away many older teachers. Is unfair in dealings with students and faculty. Has hurt the reputation of the school.
1555,"Not a good study hall teacher. You tell him things that are private, and he gets people in trouble because of it."
1605,"They call this lady Cruella Deville,,,The only time she was seem to be friendly was at the Jr Sr prom and was she crocked,made a fool of herself . This lady is all materialistic not to be trusted.So sad to see false self asteam in an administrator ."
1655,Please just get outta here. Please. I beg you. Take some holy water before entering this godamn class.
1705,HAS FAVORITES---UNLESS YOU'RE FAMILY IS MADE OF MONEY AND GOING TO DONATE TO THE SCHOOL--DON'T BOTHER WITH HER--SHE WON'T BOTHER WITH YOU!!!!
1755,"The only people that can tolerate Mrs. Finn, are the people that have apparently never entered ""her"" library."

1856,"she's a total b i t c h, and she totally ruined our school. she is a bully to both teachers and students, and i hope that b i t c h gets fired soon."
1906,Is unclear with things and makes decisions for other people. I mean seriously can I get a wine glass at prom????
1956,As a parent I have to agree that Mr. Pellegrino is one of the worst adminstrators I have ever met. The Berea City Schools need to do some major house cleaning if they ever hope to pass another levy.
2006,"Should have quit after sustaining massive head injuries. Horrible coach and teacher, but very nice guy. Poor role model"
2056,"EGO, EGO, EGO,Does this guy have anything else to show us? How about some quality time with students?"
2107,i don't care working for her either. there is no working with her because it's either her way or no way. it's going to be another dreadful year with her and the rest of the administration.
2157,Never mean to me personally but for what she and the rest of the administration did to Mrs. (Dolly) Parker I seriously believe she has no reason in her head.
2207,"I dont like this guy. let lacrosse be a varsity sport already we passed a levy what else do you want? hes not a pleasent dude. seriously who spells ""kyle"" with a ""c"" anyway?"
2257,"I don't know why the middle school hired after he was fired from his old job. They could have hired some random person and they would be better. He just really needs to stop talking about; waterpolo, the store BJ's, and the same kids he locked in a car."
2307,she a rude lady you are not a teacher nor a helful lady you are not to go around looking for ids you r to sit behind the desk and listen to your boss go on early matraitity leave please..
2357,"she is the meanest person ever she doesnt care about you, she pretends that she wants you to pass, she only cares for the ones that really good in math and the ones that aren't she couldn't care less. in my opion she should be fired and replaced with someone who cares and that can teach."
2408,worst teacher ive ever had! ONLY shows powerpoints. she is non-relational. GROSS warts on her arms. please get your tumors removed asap. oh and say etc. one more time and see what happens.
2458,she takes out her anger on the jr. high kids but she doesnt notice she does it if she cant handle this job then she needs to do something else
2508,"This is going way back. She hated me and my brother. The nunnery must not have wanted her in the convent, and now she is just a bitter religion teacher."
2558,he is horrible... ive seen him make people cry because he is so mean. i dont know why they brought his hairy self back to lane. hope he gets fired again.
2608,How did she buck union seniority? There are so many other better-qualified teachers who are stuck in worse New Haven schools.
2659,Overall she just is not a good prinicpal. She tries to put rules in place that really do not matter and needs to get more involved instead of thinking she has things under control from her office.
2709,"Hey kids, if this is the same Kevin Haney that taught at St Joes in Hammonton then look out. We loved him as a teacher and then he went online and talked behind everybody's back. He mocked the kids who loved him and said they were puppets eating out of his hand. He shamed students for being overweight or having acne. He seems cool but he is as fake as they get. Don't trust him."
2759,The guy should retire to play golf since thats all he cares about. I got an A in his class but I butted heads with him all year! I give him a BIG BOOOOO!!
2809,"I wish she retired, she's so lazy and doesn't teach music at all. To her she's just making herself look good."
2859,"Nice guy, if you tell him what he wants to hear. Extra points if you ""confide"" in him or suggest he's ""inspirational,"" as in Dead Poets Society or History Boys."
2909,"If you're looking to be in the best marching band in town,then Mr. Kelley's your guy. But if a solid music education with clear, consistent parent notification is what you want..go to another school!"
2960,"Bill is a baseball coach who masquerades as an Algebra teacher. Fortunately, some of us see through his clever disguise. Bill seems out of his element in class."
3010,"He is never in his office and when you need to talk to him, he sends you to somebody else. The only people he's nice to are the athletes of the school."
3060,Could we please play sports in gym class? i would have really enjoyed some good old fashioned games of dodgeball or basketball.
3110,Mrs.Bacon rules the school. She is soo nice but sometimes she can be strict and all she does is turn on a telekast and has us watch it. She doesn't even teach.
3160,"shes so annoying and mean and locks everyone's locks backwards. Like honestly, if you leave your lock open and someone steals you stuff then that is your punishment. its not necessary."
3210,"we arent going to be ""super duper quiet"" so dont ask. putting our heads down on our desks isnt very good punishment either"
3261,Rimpfel's total disregard for his students is the sole reason I have not visited the school and will never donate a second or a dime to anything affiliated with CV
3311,"Well, she's a nice person and all...but when Japan is on the ""caribbean"" plate.....(of which there is none)...you gotta wonder...."
3361,I couldn't stand Mrs.Handel. One of the reasons I took French was b/c I didn't want to risk getting her!!!
3411,I think Andy Fenoy of the Buckley School is the most useless teacher in the entire school. If someone would please fire him it being doing me a big favor. The amount of crap that he gives me is immense.
3461,"yells a lot, called me a spoiled brat, very disrespectful, doesnt get that school comes before after school activities, swore at our entire class"
3511,"I ENJOY SOCCER, AND IT'S MY HOBBY... HER HOBBY IS YELLING AND SCREAMING!!! OMG!! BUY A 100 PACK EARPLUGS,KEEP EM IN YOUR LOCKER!!!!"
3562,Very inapropriate with students. Had an incident involving police with a student. Be careful. Has been put on watch.
3612,Pretty much a waste of tax money - ! She never moved from her seat in the cafeteria! She didn't keep the halls clear or the noise down
3662,"heard this was her last year teaching, must say could care less about her now that i read the newspapers. parents will not stand for her to teach,"
3712,"i hate this man, he destroyed our band program. He sits there and ridules and is dead weight to the students work. And you wonder why everyone quits band???"
3762,"will somebody please do something about her? she reads to us for 40 minutes strait it is a free for all people do what they want, no teaching ever goes on. im not a good student but want more"
3812,Her class is pretty easy but rally doesn't teach. She allows us to do whatever at times. Too involved in her sports and brings her sports into class.
3863,"An incredibly sweet woman who really didn't have a clue about what was happening. Every time she left to make copies of assignments, the populars and their followers would have a look-out guard the door and proceed to jump on her computer and change their grades. People would cheat with their books open on their desk and she wouldn't notice, but she's catch the kids who had papers hidden under their shoes. She was in over her head. A nice lady but she can't teach or control teenagers."
3913,"doesnt teach, always yells, and only supports the best of the best players, chasing away those who need actual help."
3963,THIS WOMAN COULDN'T TELL ART IF IT HIT HER IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. SHE IS 1 OF THE WORST TEACHERS I EVER HAD FOR 2WEEKS!!! THE ART SHES TEACHES IS 4 PRE-SCHOOL
4013,I think Chuck is unfair in his coaching practices. He loves to intimidate his players as opposed to gaining their respect through his coaching techniques. He also loves to brag about what he owns.
