719,Ms. Stubbs is a insufficent teacher and is not capable of creating a safe and caring environment for the students she teaches. Please do not get the idea I don't respect her because the state of her
863,"As a parent I feel that Ms. Alemany should choose another profession. She is inadequate as a teacher, who does not care about her students."
1007,This is the only teacher my child has ever had an issue with in 11 years of schooling. She has zero compassion for students and their personal circumstances. She is unwilling to adjust her approach to a way that child might learn more effectively. My child and I have both reached out to her to try and get my child the extra help to succeed and she refused. This teacher marks assignments as zeros for my child when they are complete & correct because she assumes they aren't before checking.
1151,Janet Payne has no tolerance for less than perfect children. She uses harsh words shouted in their ears and belittles infront of the other children. Unless your child is stellar in the classroom bewar

1727,"My child comes home every day, in tears, bawling on my shoulder. Carol Ward is an awful teacher, with no respect for her students. The homework they are required to complete each night, in such little time, with no explanation of how to do so, is unbelievably unacceptable. This problem should be resolved VERY soon."
1871,"Mrs Yetto has turned more students off to music than she will ever inspire. She uses bullying and fear tactics as instuments of ""education"". She does not provide substantive instruction or materials."

2158,She cares to much about sports and does not recognize excelling students but rather those who bring home sports trophies.
2302,she doesn't respect students so she doesn't get respect back also she doesn't care about teaching anyone
2446,He was condescending to the students. At one point verbally abusive to a student to the point the student withdrew from the class. At the end of the semester most of the students had withdrawn. The principal defended him even though there was evidence of the verbal abuse (statements from other students). I would recommend him for no teaching job.
2590,you need to be more considerate of your students treat us with some respect then maybe students will like you!
2734,"I'm a Parent of an Honor student.. my son didn't tell me until the the end of the year that Mr. Arroyo's teachings were slightly unethical.. his constant taunts and sarcasm towards his students were very insulting and undermining.. at first I said to my son,maybe it's you being too sensitive, but after speaking to several other parents they agreed and were so dissatisfied with the way he taught. He would tease, taunt and sometimes make fun of his students. he's only nice to his baseball team.."
2878,"Verbal and written communications sent home to parents are extremely condescending. Never had a problem with my kid enjoying school until her. I've never met a teacher so rude and talks down to parents if things are not done her way. Everyday my kid comes home I hear stories of how Garcia has yelled at them and made the entire class run for ""talking"". The environment for children especially small children should be warm and welcoming not hostile. In a nutshell no I would not recommend her."
3022,"she is friendly to popular kids, and helps them more than she should, while ignoring her own students."
3166,She is not meant to be a principal. She does not know how to deal with certain situations at all. When students try to express themselves to her she does not try to hear it. Instead she makes assumptions and does not give the right information. I believe she is not eligible to be dealing with students our age.
3310,"Very rude, does not like kids, especially her students(unless they are a cheerleader), never available for a conference with a parent or a student when she says she will be. NO HELP what-so-ever when students ask for it, as a parent if you try to ask all you get is an attitude. Good luck to anyone who gets her as a teacher, I am truly sorry for you and your child."
3454,Not helpful. She is too caught up into her social life. Doesn't care about her students. Learn how to teach and show compasssion toward us.

3742,"Dr. Joe Gilhaus works for the district office now. He has made a new transfer policy in which is unfair to students in the Shawnee mission district. This man doesn't have any respect for children, and he certainly does not have what it takes to be a teacher."
3886,Unimpressive as an educator. More worried about himself and his outside interests. He does not care about students and is just going through the motions. School district does not care -- too many bad teachers like this.
4030,My child was never happy in her class and complained of many instances where she treats the kids unfairly. She has no compassion for the kids in class and is plain rude to them most of the times.
4173,"it is very obvious that dr. birch favors certain students over others, and if you are unfortunate enough to be one of those she does not favor, she could not care less about you."
4317,Terrible principal! Doesn't help the students when they need it. The vice principal does more work then her!
4461,"As a parent, we dis-liked Ms Palumbo, at her previous school Desert Vista, she was considered rude and unhelpful. As parents we met with Deot head/Asst Princpal to complain and eventually they listened and she was fired in May 2012. She is rude to parents, dismissive and intolerant, to pupils she was mean and divisive. She seems to live through NatLatin League and uses it to forward herself at the expense of students, Oh Seton Catholic, you don't know what you have done hiring her!"
4605,I would hardly call him a teacher. He listens to the same music every day during class and tells his students that they are not allowed to ask him for help. Disgrace to his profession.
4749,"Mrs. Back is one of the few teachers that I have absolutely no respect for. She has no respect for her students, and deserves none in return."
4893,She didn't acknowledge that some students may need extra help or extra clarification- I came in as a straight A's student and walked out with a C.. good luck.
5037,Horrible. Experience. Did not grade properly. Blames fault on students and doesn't take blame for his own mistakes. Bad guy
5181,"She is rather rude to certain parents whose children are core(zone) students, and very nice to parents whose children are magnet students.She's helpful if you are not hispanic or black,not a good person to be in her position, you have to treat all children the same fairness goes a long way,people tend to notice the difference quickly.Magnet parents are treated like GOLD and Core (ZONE KIDS) need I have to spell it out , it is without a doubt different in treatment at this school."
5325,"mr bushee is one of the rudest, most cruel teachers i have ever had! he derives fun from making fun of his students! its also nearly impossible to get an 'A' in his class. dont take him, take Mr Lee!"
5469,"if the average score on a test is an F and the high score is a C, isn't that a sign it's the teacher's fault and not the students'?"
5613,"Tends to think students are wrong at everything, is extremely critical of student's writing, and tends to pick favorites. Nice guy, but he needs some work."
5757,"Cindy Riordan clearly mixes politics with her take on the education system. She teaches and grades her students from a bias perspective based on the parents' politcal affiliations and views, that are generally reflected in their children. She will punish a student and more harshly grade their work if she senses a parent is not on her side of the political spectrum."
