9879,"I don't know if it's really that she's a bad teacher or whatever, or if it just that her teaching method doesn't work for me (or any of her students, for that matter), but I honestly can't comprehend why we have to to the SAME freaking work for EVERY freaking novel that we freaking read.
April Micolino is: Still Teaching but I wish she wasn't
I am an: exhausted student
I was born in: like i'm going to tell the truth
What grade: well she hates me, if that says anything."
9999,i don't get all the hype about this woman... she is not the best teacher ever. we did no real life situation writing such as essays or information. we just did vocab powerpoints.
10120,I completely hate her! She is so rude to everyone and doesnt take anything into consideration. People who are great at french and spanish will raise their hands all the time and still be treated badly. WE ALL HATE HER!
10240,HE is kind of full of himself. Not real clear on helping out. I don't think he is really the type to be instructing people.
10361,"While it's true that he is what makes the band good, it's also true that he is incredibly rude to anyone that is not a senior. Beware, freshmen, if you join Marching Band. Do not give him any reason to hate you. If you obey his every word and predict what he wants, you'll have an easy year. Other then that, band is really easy to get a high grade in, so........"
10481,I can't stand this class she thinks all we have to do is memorize bible passages like yeah we're going to use this in life. I loved last years religion class n miss it so much
10602,"He tries his best to be tough, but it just doesn't work!!! A word of advice: if you wouldn't get mad at every little thing than 8th would tease you so much"
10722,"I was to afraid of her to even think about learning. She is rude, aloof, and thinks her personal life is more important than giving her students an education."
10843,"bye bye, good riddance. awful teacher and person. he was always mean and nasty because he was bitter he never made it to the big leagues. glad to see him go."
10963,she is a funny lady. she is very quirky and has trouble staying on topic (which is much better than when she does cuz it is way boring) she gives way too much homework though!!!
11084,Mrs madden is not what everyone says she is she has her favorites and if your quite in her class she embarres you not a great teacher
11204,"Ugh. She really is a bad teacher. She treats everyone like we're 10 and barely teaches anything. Plus, her tests are really hard. I'm a freshman, and hopefully I'll get a better teacher next year so that I can pass the Regents."
11325,i don't like this teachers approah because if the bell rings and you are right in the door way you have to go to the tap table and i don't think thats fair!
11445,She us the worst teacher you can ever have! Mt daughter had herder reading lab and she yells at the students WAY too much. She sends them to the office just for talking. Which I think is not right for my child.
11566,"she expects us to think shes the greatest teacher/person you've ever met. she tries to 'council' us & give us a life lesson during her class. if you dont, she feels sad and starts to cry & hate you."
11686,"sherri is the meanest person i have ever met like 1 time i went to her to complain about things going missing from my desk over night and she screams at me ""I HAVE NO CONTROLL OF THAT!!!!"" yea"
11807,i couldn't understand him at first but now i think he is ok...not that bad....ask a lot of questions in class and he'll give a good grade
11927,"She wasn't just strict, yes it's understands that teachers are strict, but she was just plain mean. She doesn't connect with the students and often yells at the smallest things. The work in class was all textbook and not creative at all. It was 42 minutes of pure torture. Once in class, she dropped a Snapple and it shattered all over the floor. She picked up the largest pieces of glass and left the rest. She left tiny shards of glass and drops of Snapple. One of them worst teachers ever."
