383,She is very strict and has a tendency to be very sarcastic and rude to her students but expects respect back.

1007,This is the only teacher my child has ever had an issue with in 11 years of schooling. She has zero compassion for students and their personal circumstances. She is unwilling to adjust her approach to a way that child might learn more effectively. My child and I have both reached out to her to try and get my child the extra help to succeed and she refused. This teacher marks assignments as zeros for my child when they are complete & correct because she assumes they aren't before checking.
1055,He makes no sense in class and is extremely lazy. He's also inappropriate and has little authority over students.
1103,It has been an awful experience with my child being in her class this year. She displays an unwillingness to work with parents or resolve issues. As a classroom leader I was shocked at her lack of accountability or willingness to escalate a matter if she was incapable to resolve on her own. When met with an opportunity to explain her actions she was only willing to offer an excuse rather than a reason. Very disappointed.
1151,Janet Payne has no tolerance for less than perfect children. She uses harsh words shouted in their ears and belittles infront of the other children. Unless your child is stellar in the classroom bewar

He does not follow an IEP and will complain that it is too much work for him to follow. He has has a terrible communication problem even with parents. I have never experienced a teacher who could be so cold and heartless to a child in need and am surprised they would keep him as he is a detriment to a struggling child's self-esteem.

This teacher does not show a lot of respect in students, and she is not fair to the students as when it comes to raising your hand and questions. I don't recommend taking this class unless you really want to have a miserable day most of the time."
1583,I am very unhappy with the lack of professionalism here by the faculty nd the things they say. (Especially this one)

1727,"My child comes home every day, in tears, bawling on my shoulder. Carol Ward is an awful teacher, with no respect for her students.

1967,Very disrespectful to his students and expects them to treat him with respect that he doesn't deserve. Very disruptive during mass by doing dress code checks.
2015,Certainly one of the best teachers Westlake has to offer. If you want your child to have a great kindergarten experience I recommend him!
2062,I find it frustrating when Miss Loftus sends notes home. Wouldn't it be more professional to call me. I truely believe she doesn't have enough experience with education.

2398,Students who are lucky enough to have Mrs. Moore as their freshmen English teacher will leave her class better writers and more mature individuals. Truly in the top few teachers I have had.
2446,He was condescending to the students. At one point verbally abusive to a student to the point the student withdrew from the class. At the end of the semester most of the students had withdrawn. The principal defended him even though there was evidence of the verbal abuse (statements from other students). I would recommend him for no teaching job.
2494,Uses terror pshcology on students which makes classroom very uncomfortable and unwelcoming. We constantly threatens people with the term do you want an F?

He would tease, taunt and sometimes make fun of his students. he's only nice to his baseball team.."

2878,"Verbal and written communications sent home to parents are extremely condescending. Never had a problem with my kid enjoying school until her. I've never met a teacher so rude and talks down to parents if things are not done her way. Everyday my kid comes home I hear stories of how Garcia has yelled at them and made the entire class run for ""talking"". The environment for children especially small children should be warm and welcoming not hostile. In a nutshell no I would not recommend her."
2926,Mrs. Zoz is very good at telling you what is wrong with your child but not good at offering solutions. She believes that all students should fit a particular type and fails to understand how to teach to those students who do not fit that idea.

3166,She is not meant to be a principal. She does not know how to deal with certain situations at all. When students try to express themselves to her she does not try to hear it. Instead she makes assumptions and does not give the right information. I believe she is not eligible to be dealing with students our age.

3454,Not helpful. She is too caught up into her social life. Doesn't care about her students. Learn how to teach and show compasssion toward us.
3502,You deserve NO respect because that's what you give your students. Try treating people as fellow human beings for a change (if you even know what that means).
3550,"Awful experience, our son has never struggled like he has this year. This teacher has made a few snarky comments directed towards our son, and has failed to effectively teach math.

3742,"Dr. Joe Gilhaus works for the district office now. He has made a new transfer policy in which is unfair to students in the Shawnee mission district. This man doesn't have any respect for children, and he certainly does not have what it takes to be a teacher."
3790,Barb Hilovsky may be very very very old but her level of maturity just barely matches that of an eight year old. SHe picks fights with students and is rude beyond belief. I am a straight A student but my parents had to have 3 plus meetings with her due to the rude commentary and stressful environment she put forth.
3838,"she is uncapable of respecting her students yet she acuses the students of disrespecting her. completely inefficience and unrealistic teaching philosophy. as a matter of fact, she hasnt taught us anything."
