1357,jones enjoys informing his students of their lack of talent/potential because he played at carnegie hall and it was the pinnacle of his life. FAIL.

1433,This teacher has no clue how to teach a foreign language. She expects 1st and 2nd year students to absorb a foreign language with little effort on her part to teach.

School District should look into her teaching style and lack of skills more closely.

1810,Mr. Archangel has very little knowledge of the subject matter that he teaches. He has lectured on subjects many times and has to be constantly corrected by the students. Additionally he consistently interjects not fact but rather opinion into world and national events but tries to pass them off as fact. He's typically prepared for class and often seems as if he's trying to figure out what we are supposed to be doing. Grading policies are never objective but very subjective. Bad...just bad.

2225,Her teaching is poor and her personal opinion for in the way of her teaching.

2300,Hes okay but when it comes to teaching he lacks the ability to teach he should stick with another career.
2338,Ms.Manier is very rude and inconsiderate. She refuses to restate or elaborate on a topic which leads to most of he class being confused. She grades assignments very harshly (when she grades). She is frequently absent and she very rarely grades assignments (to the point that she comes off as lazy). She seems generally uninterested in her classes and she doesn't seem to have a deep understanding of the topics she teaches.

2489,"Mr. Mikula has greater than 70% of his students consistently failing his class. He does not provide any quality instruction. For example, his teaching method is primarily look in the textbook answer the questions, if you can't figure it out on your own...too bad for you. He takes no ownership of the results of his instruction. So much for accountability...huh? I hope they bring charter school funding so some kids like me can get good math instruction. He does not know or care about us."
2527,"I have Ms Murrey for AP Euro and she does not seem to have much knowledge at all on the subject. She expects us to teach ourselves only from the textbook, is very vague in class when we ask her specific questions, and relies on powerpoints and other materials supplied from other teachers. I try hard in her class and still barely have passing grades. She is overall not a quality teacher"
2564,Mediocre teacher at best. Very little insight into subject material. Just all around bland and not a great teacher.

2640,She may be the worst teacher I have ever had. It seems like to me that she does not want her students to get a grade in her class. She is knowledgeable about the subject but should not be teaching.
2677,"Although not effective at teaching, he brightened up each day with the way he is unknowingly hilarious and wise. Thanks, Doug. May the force be with you."
2715,"She focuses on too much critiquing, and not actually getting hands on with the subject. wish i got garner"
2753,Gave way too much work. Very disorganized--he would repeat one lesson plan manytimes and then forget to teach another lesson plan to one class. Still a nice guy
2791,Mr. Larson is very unclear and not very creative when it comes to his lessons. He needs to demmand more respect from his classes.
2828,"My son had the unfortunate experience of being in Ms. Taffaro-Chica's class. She is a very unpleasant person to communicate with, and my son was exposed to very little new material in her class. Overall, this was a compete waste of time."
2866,She's totally off-base. Her teaching methods are exactly great. She's unorganized and unhelpful. She spend more time on the phone then with the class
2904,"overall , kerwin is acool guy but he talks too much. he should focus more on teaching instead of his past centuries in connecticut"
2941,I particuarly did not like ms. jackson because she was so unorganized and did not teach us very well. I am so glad she is leaving McMeans to teach at an elementary school!!!
2979,"Mrs. Henry's (Honors Pre-Calculus) tests do not reflect the material she has presented in class, so most of her students have become frustrated and despondent. She seems oblivious and/or unconcerned to the fact that she really, truly is the reason her students are not learning."
3017,Doesnt seem to be sure what he's talkign about. Has some wierd philosophy about teaching. He's the worst.
