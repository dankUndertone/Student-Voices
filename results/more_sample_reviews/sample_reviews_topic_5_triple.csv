38,"She enjoys making her students feel bad about themselves. By the way, I do my work and have As in her classes."
77,Mr. Barker is very strict and he acts like we're a bunch of college students or something. He's scares a lot of people too.
115,You don't seem to really care about what your teaching and it sometimes seems like all you want to do is get class overwith...how am i supposed to want to be there??
154,ya i didnt like him at all and i would get into fights with him becuase he would bug out about something that didnt matter but the class was fun haha
192,mrs. simanowith can be nice but if she doesnt like you she is never going to be nice to you. she blames EVERYTHING on kids she doesnt like even if it wasnt their fault
231,scariest teacher i ever had- made me scared to raise my hand. He made fun of kids. YAWW DAVIS go to angermanegment
269,"He's an okay teacher, he treats us like trash sometimes and discourages our class. He doesn't even teach us. Its a teaching yourself class."
308,I don't really care for Mrs.Mazza that much!She seems like shes not a very nice teacher and doesn't really care about anyone! and she can be strict at times
346,"He wasn't a very good teacher. He's an okay guy but he's always picking on certain kids and never helps his students. Plus, he's very unorganized."
385,"She makes you like her in the begining, then she gets worse, and never explains things She wants you to figure it out on your own. That never works, and then she gets annoyed when you don't get it"
423,I can't stand him. He has no respect for students and treats you like you're some criminal if you're late for class or something. Worse than the Stephcan.
462,she is mean and tries her hardest to make her students feel bad about themselves. She made me feel so stupid I wanted to cry.
500,"That is right. He doesn't help you. Like the first review, it seems like he doesn't care and if you don't understand, its your fault."
539,"she is honestly so fake. she pretends to be this nice and loving teacher, but she actually is really bad at her job. She makes students feel bad about themselves, and she's always in a ""mood"". Do not recommend for anyone."
577,"didnt like her, moody, makes up things right on the spot, and was late to class every morning... happy she is gone"
616,"i hated this class, hes tries to act tough when hes not and he tries to act all friendly when you really dont want to be bothered. he just tries to hard"
654,ughh he acts like we are the stupidest class he has ever had and when we don't understand something he says he makes it seem like we weren't paying attention and did something wrong don't take tech ed
693,Unfortuntely Mrs.Fesseden does not know how to react with kids.If she did students would like her.Her class wasn't exactly a place I enjoyed learning in.
731,"I was humiliated at how we sounded at our concert. He is so unorganized, and seems to only care aobut his highschool group."

808,our class is always disorderly with people getting off task...shouldn't have taken this class at all...
847,"She is to strict and stuck in the old days. She is short with people when they try to ask questions. She also acts all high and mighty,like a first class snob!"

962,i've never met anyone who's liked her. treats high schoolers like they're in preschool and is way too strict. i quit taking french because i didn't want to have her as a teacher for another year.
1001,Isla knows that people coming out of her class don't like her because she is tough on the late policy and she always complains about reading our terrrible homework. I dreaded coming to her class.
1039,"Pick favorites, always has an attitude and you are the rudiest teacher ever. So who should put forth more effort?"
1078,"She seems to think of herself as the messiah of the middle school, ""i know this rule seems stupid and i don't like it either"" while obviously liking punsihin u."
1116,Mrs. Kar is the type of teacher that you don't wanna have for an AP class... She makes you feel bad about yourself!
1155,I have a really hard to talk to Mrs.Moody. I just feel like she is judging me when I try to talk to her. I don't feel like I can talk to her... Sorry.
1193,"Take Mr. Lane's class, then you don't go to school too early. He is alway late, ten min. late ls normal. no matter is morning or afternoon class."
1232,I don't feel like he values anybody's opinion. The hallways are crazy. We don't have chorus and it was really good for some kids.
1270,he sound like he teachers kindergarten or somethin...so weird so imature and seems like he has nothing in his brain
1309,Mrs. Rawlston is no help at all. I always forget she's the counselor: She never seems to be doing her job.

1540,"She picks on the athletes all the time, almost like she has a vendetta or something. Bad high school experience so now you're getting even? Get over it and try putting your energy into teaching."
1578,"Mr.Candy always says that he knows everyone, like the world champion...or the best... but you always show off!your jokes r dumb and U never care about anyone hurt. No one likes u!"
1617,"Mrs. Faszewski is a bad teacher. All she did was put me down. I was an athlete and I always tried hard in her class, yet she never respected me. She'll only like you if your are physically challenged."

1848,"Worst teacher ever. Hates students. Has ridiculously high expectations of sophomore work, yet treats 15-year-olds like 5 year olds... also flips out if you're wearing scented lotion."
1886,Eccentric (in a bad way). Does not control her class. Seems to be biased against conservative thinkers.
1925,She really doesn't teach well at all and doesn't make the class enjoyable at all. It feels more like torture than a class about the history of our world which should impress all of us and make us all interested to learn more but she ruins it. She makes it feel like pure work and stresses out her students immensely. I have heard nobody who enjoys her class. Not one student likes her.
1963,"She treats the class like 5-year-olds, and is surprised when they act like it. She seems like a nice person, but not an excellent teacher. Unclear explanations--i'm always confused"
2002,What is wrong with this guy. Something is wrong. I can tell and so can most everyone. He is not normal and it is sad.
2040,"She acts like she doesn't want to teach us at all. She is so focused on her ""diploma"" she doesn't even care about her classes. Even if she wanted to teach us it wouldn't make difference."

2156,"couldn't really control his class, people were always running wild. hopefully, as the years go by, he'll gain more experience n be a better teacher than he was."
2194,"She has almost no authority. It seems like she could be a lot more helpful if she wasn't scared of us (i think she actually knows a lot about art)BTW, this ISN'T a bird class.HARD"
2233,"a bad teacher. she acts above all her students instead of treating them like human beings. very strict, sort of has an old school mentality on teaching - that teachers know it all and kids are evil"
2271,"He actually stated that he did not want too many people to pass his class, not a nice way to start. Does not like to explain and makes you feel bad for asking."
2310,"I really don't like his assemblies, the jokes are bad and the ""cheer"" is dumb. He also is an incompetent teacher."
2348,"She was cool at the beginning of the year, but now she gives off an ""im better then you"" attitude, dont like it, dont like her"
2387,Ms.Spruill is not a very good teacher she picks favorite and upsets a lot of people. she also gives you bad grades if she doesnt like you that much and its always for stupid things

2618,she doesnt teach anything at all and shes always out of it but I think her heart is in the rite place and i feel bad for her that she cant control her class
2656,"She would act like my best friend sometimes, and other times would pretend she'd never even spoken to me. Just not a very nice person in general."
2695,This teacher is one you don't want to get to know. She'll try to find a way to lower your grade and she acts like she has something against everyone
2733,"I really dont like FACE SHE IS NOT A GOOD TEACHER, NOT TO MANY PEOPLE LIKE HER. sHE ISNT ORGANIZED AT ALL."
2772,"if you like to sleep and daydream, he's the teacher for you. or if you like mushy sayings he's your man. don't get me started."
