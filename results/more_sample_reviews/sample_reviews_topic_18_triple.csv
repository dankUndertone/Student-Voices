17,"In my opinion, Mr. B has a select group of students (in all his classes) who are ""special"" and get ""privileges"". If you're not in that ""special"" group, you're ignored."
35,i think that she plays the favorites game and if you arent part of her circle you dont get the attention that each student deserves.
53,"Too moody, doesn't care about the choir at all. If only she cared more, then we'd be a much better group. Often plays favortites, and doesn't teach much at all."
70,He is a low key drama starter between girls and he only has one student which he adores.
88,"Discrimination, Unless in marching band as a student you mean notheing to this teacher. If you are in other band but not marching band.Not fair"
106,You should really stop playing favorites with the popular preps of BHS. Its not fair to the rest of your students. Your favoritism is so obvious. ZORRO
124,Chooses favorites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
141,"I've had bad situlations in the past. She does favorites, and disrespects the ones who's not on the favorite list. I also had friends who had experanced her bullying her students. Not so good...."
159,"Let's just say that she wasn't one of my favorites. It was obvious who her favorites were, and she just kind of put everyone else aside. She's very unclear."
177,He is a very very bad man. He hurt my feelings on several occasions and hurt my friends. He made us do fashion shows for his own pleasure.
195,Makes the student hate music. I think the goal of varsity band at Huron is to make kids quit playing.
212,she was the principal there and when i and a few of my friends were badly bullied we were completely ignored.
230,"If you're not one of her favorites, you will suffer for the rest of the school year"
248,"He is a horrible, bias teacher. He is too obsessed with his own things. He never grades fairly and play favoritism!"
266,"She is a fave picker and doesnt let other students be dancers, or have main parts. we only get 2-3 lines."
283,Choosing favorites and forgetting that other students exist is not a good way to be. Just some friendly constructive criticism if Mrs. Laudin were to read this.
301,"Sorry, I have to fall on the side of ""not good"", unless you are one of her favorites (then I am sure you love her). Shows extreme partiality, and can be very harsh to those who aren't on her chosen l"
319,"i think your policies are totally out of line, i dont think your a good teacher, you are unfair you definatly choose favorites and it shows alot in the way you talk to people."
337,"Not as cruel and unfair as Eberle but jumps at the chance to get you in trouble. Shes nice if you say hi in the hallway, unlike Eberle."
354,"to put it bluntly she is ahorrible teacher with no sense of how bad her orchestra is, she picks bad songs and favorites while forcing the few talented people in the orchestra to switch out."
372,"Mr.Thomas, if you would pay attention and not ignor your students when they are tryin to help maybe the band would sound so bad and the choir would sing better."
390,She's a good dancer. but because she acts like she's 2 everyone quit the play that I was looking foward to! She ruined drama for me.
408,"Plays favorites and to wrapped up in a popularity contests-student counsel, does not give everyone the same attention."
425,"I didn't have her as a teacher, but from what I've heard is that she favors certain students and let's the popular crowd take over the yearbook. She likes things her way."
443,Totally the pits. Doesn't seem to have any direction or plan. You can't do anything with choir ever. If people in a choir could sing they would sing solo. People sing in a choir to cover up bad singing. I took choir because Band Orchestra and Art mean work.
461,Not the band it once was or ever will be. I dont think he can get us ready to play well or even pick good music...and is not understanding! he is a big letdown.
478,ms blauvelt made my life a living hell at porter. she definitely chooses favorites and if your not one of her favorites you are going down ?????
496,Mrs. Littke does not treat everyone with the same fairness. She selects a few pets and spends all her time and attion on them only
514,"Not a bad guy, just a bad teacher. He uses transparencies, and just reads off of them. Not too many opportunities for points(except e.c). All his AP kids love him, but not too many Phys. students do."
532,Mrs. Paris is mean and isn't helpful. all she does is pick a side( part 1 or part 2) then complain about it.
549,"Ms. Null is the ultimate ""favorite player"". If you're one of her favorites you're sure to get a solo regardless of talent. Believe me I've sat through enough of her concerts to know that her favorites are not always that talented. Maybe it's a case of a talentless teacher wanting to help out talentless students."
567,Mr. Karem always had favorite students. It was obvious. He put average students down to promote his favorites. The smart ones learned quickly to worship him to get an A!
585,she does not talk to students. it is obvious that she likes some more than others and grades according to who she likes
603,Mr. Ormond speaks in a monotone voice and has favorites. He isn't very clear on the subject. I love his tootsie rolls though.
620,Mrs Anderson was one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She played very heavy favorites with the really smart people and the people who were in NASA club. Did poorly in class.
638,"Mean and uncaring. Is only nice to students she plays favorites with (jocks), all others she is unfair and cruel to."
656,"I don't like him very much at all. He show's favouritism toward the jocks, cheerleaders, and dancers. He's hard of hearing or maybe he has selective hearing."
674,"Dalia Bach is only good at picking out music for students, other than that she doesn't do much. She forces you to sing styles that you don't like. If you have the chance, pick a different voice coach."

798,He makes fun of me almost everyday. he definitly pics favorites and basically every high school girl is on his favorites list hmmmm. and he is super lazy
816,wow. total jerk. plays favorites. and possibly picks the absolute worst kids to be prefects every year.
833,I'm going to be honest here...Mr. Shimp is a very adequate orchestra teacher. He's very disorganized and is poor at putting class grades in. He's not that good at conducting an orchestra either...probably because he hasn't played one single string instrument.
851,"Mr. Rondina is a good man and definitly knows a lot about music theory and piano, but his choral and vocal knowledge is questionable."
869,bad teacher. she doesent even show us what we got on stuuf that we did in class grades EVERYTHING and play favorites. if you didnt sing or couldnt play an insturment she failed you and you just sat

940,"everyone else is right, she reads from the book, and definitely picks out the students she doesn't like."
957,Unless your a favorite you don't do well and she judges speeches professionaly instead of on a high school level
975,Her favoritism is extremely obvious in that it affects students' grades and it shows in her attitude toward certain students.
993,DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! He will not listen to you. He only listens to his favorites from Cram. I played harder songs in a middle school orchestra!

1046,"great teacher but plays favorites, and if you are not a good player, he will let you know and you will be miserable in class. Nice guy though."

1082,"Horrible horrible teacher! Has her favorites, and completly ignores the rest. Terrible grading scale!"
1099,Mr. White does not help you very much and he is not clear on what he wants you to do. He is much better than Hartnett though!

1188,"She didnt really teach that well and the only people she ever called on was the cheerleaders. She definately has her favorites, and i wasnt one of them!"
1206,"Miss Bonneau is not a good teacher. She assigns the worst pieces that require no practice at all. During band all she does is try to make jokes, and most of the class she works with two different sections of the band. There are 50 some kids in my band and she works with at most 20 a day. She doesn't pay any attention to the percussion, like, I threw a stick across the percussion section and she didn't notice. I guess it's not all bad though because on Mondays and Fridays we use our phones ;)"
1224,"I quit band, never liked him when I was in band and i don't care for him now. Way too weird, strict, made me hate band and my instrument."
1241,She has favorites and shes moody and does not know how to teach ..my class had to show her how to do many things
1259,"Yes, it's very obvious she plays favorites, and it's not even based on your artistic skills. She talks too much and can be overly critical."
1277,"shes nice, but don't be fooled. she has a sneaky way of playing favorites and loves to get kids in a lot of trouble"
1295,"he's ok he is HIGHLY OVER RATED. You have to be one of his favorites to appreciate him, he usually jokes with the popular girls. he isnt that good"
1312,shes nice at first... until you get on her bad side. and when youre on her bad side her class is horrible. she was gossiping about my friend with other students. who does that?! also she judges you on how your friends behave so make sure they are behaving themselves in class with you if you plan on having a good year...
1330,"She is passive aggressive, and a really bad grader. I got good grades in her class, but my friends who did equal quality work did so much worse than me. She made 3 people cry in my class. She clearly picks favorites."
1348,"I have Mr. Fey and Mr. Galli for Jazz Band. Although some of us are beginners, Mr. Fey gives us songs we've never seen and expects us to play them right away."
1365,"She definitely has favorites and does not really like to accept new people (without connections to people in the drama dept.) joining her plays. She's quite moody and bossy and I do not feel that she is a very good teacher or director. She makes the drama dept a very unwelcoming group,"
1383,"Blair is the problem with our music program at LC. I had her for orchestra and she is the reason I stopped doing something I loved. Can't even compare her to Bart (sac teacher). I got worse, not better, throughout the year. Good at choir, bad at orchestra."
1401,"By far the most unfair teacher ever.It is hard to put into words how unfair she is.She loves one kid and lets them do anything,but for everyone else she will literally make up bad things we did. O/10"
1419,"Mrs.Mac was an ok teacher i guess, but she plays favorites big time in casting her plays... which arent that great anyways... the latest play, Alice in Wonderland, put me to sleep."
