55,"2000+ pts a MP, even if HW is 10 and ther's HW everyday it's still way overdoin it, 45x10=450, leaves 1550 points for projects, quizzes, tests = 15 100-pt projects, 15 100-pt tests, or 31 50-pt quizs."
111,Loses all papers I had to redo a test 3 times Hecate she lost it lost my homework all the time . I would not recommend her as a teacher.
167,"He is such a slow grader. He still hasn't graded essays from a month ago, even though he has had plenty of time over the numerous breaks."
223,Not organized. Gives much homework- most is not collected. Her teaching seems pointless. Grade updates 1 month late. Didn't do major project-didn't affect grade
279,"She gives out way 2 much hw, she should give us a break every now and then- the final way way 2 freakin' hard"
335,"Hes so hard, all his work is muti projects. so its a bunch of little projects all combined together. Olny thing is the projects arent little."
390,Everything is very influential towards the kids. She is also very unorganized and would give major stuff all due within same week with short notice.
446,I loved her in the beginning of the year but she puts everything off until the end of the year and then loads a bunch of work on you.
502,You always change your mind about due dates for projects and papers at the last minute. Your class was very easy tho even though you gave me 4 or 5 zeros
558,I was constantly lost in his class. He just gives you labs and expects you to know how everything is done.
614,"Teacher is very unorganized, has handed my student no work back the entire year, and does not keep up with grades at all"
670,Inconsistent w/instructions...gives last minute instructions on 9 wk projects when students have completed or nearly completed them...does not tell each class the same instructions...grades harshly & inconsistently
725,Had her last year. She doesn't know how to run a class. Period. She never explains the criteria when grading because she doesn't know how to grade. One positive is that she never checks the hw because she is too lazy to get up and check. And her final is ridiculous.
781,She doesn't know half the stuff she is taking about and gives us way too much homework. Like she gave us these packets to do over winter break.
837,she doesn't tell you things and then punishes you for not following the directions she never gave you. and she loses a lot of the paperwork...very strict...: /
893,"i think she expects to much from us, gives way to much work for one homework assignment. So its either were in standard or acc never honors. plus her grading is crap"
949,I dont like you you are the meanest teacher ever and you never count my homework and you give me Cs on ever progress report and report card I have had.
1005,He is the worst. He revoked the grades that he had given me beforee multiple times. He also changed the grading system while we were taking a test. He said we wouldnt have finals but now he says we do hes the wrostarre
1060,It seems that this class is based on students teaching each other: unrealiable info. Grading is arbitrary and uneven workload: significantly more during the week than on weekends
1116,He assigns several assignments but the due dates are all very random. He expects you to know what he is thinking. He also gives you extra credit for not asking him questions?!?
1172,Lazy Teacher that gives little or no direction. Just gives out work sheets and sits are her desk and texts all day.
1228,"Don't bother doing any work at all. BS the homework and labs, he doesn't notice. Just go to the review sessions before each quiz and pay attention at those."
1284,Class makes no sense. Never talks about whats being tested. Puts grades in way late. Fed up with this class!
1340,she never hands back papers she is not only inconsitent but she is contradictory she does give extensions but rarely explains what should be doneHORRIBLE TEACHE
1395,Easy as long as you can teach yourself and keep very good track of the homeworks she looses or forgets to collect.
1451,He marks people down for subject matter that is completely new. He takes forever grading but then piles hw on students that HAVE to get it done when he doesn't.
1507,you were a very unorganized teacher you never checked the advanced classes homework but never seemed to forget to check anyother classes homework
1563,talks all class about nonsense. Gives no rubrics on what our assignments are. When asked how many points the assignments are worth he asks why we are doing it for the grade and not ourselves. Is terrible at explaining what we have to do. Gives out no papers. Doesn't put grades into the grade book until 2 weeks after the term is over. Is just overall a terrible teacher.
1619,"i dont like her. ALl she does is hand out papers and assign all of these family projects where u have to post pictures of ur fam. privacy plz! Also papers, papers, papers were trying to conserve paper"
1675,"his tests r so hard. he has da worst policy of never changing a grade once you get it back, even if it is his fault.what is 3*4, but he took off 13 points"
1730,GIVES WAYYYY to much home work the only time we dont get homework is when shes hurt or very tired(not too often)..not very nice...
1786,"He is very unclear about homework, and gives way too much, considering we have other homework from other teachers, plus afterschool activities."
1842,"Never updates skyward until after the trimester if at all. Just a lazy teacher who by the way, is as unathletic as ever."
1898,"Hard simply due to too much busy work. He will be accomadating if you ask if you can turn something in late, but then he will lie and only give you half credit."
1954,"She is the worst teacher you will ever have. She forgets everything, and is disorganized."
2010,She couldn't keep up with the assignments and the grades and didn't prepare us for our exam. I don't know what grade I ended up with in that class because she never updated edline.
2065,"Ms Lopez gives out way too much work and is way too critical. She won't grade papers for the stupidest reasons, the least of which being written in pencil. ""MENOS PUNTOS!"""
2121,I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and upon my return she expected me to have all my work completed on the first day and take ALL teh tests i missed THAT DAY. so mean & unreasonble
2177,"Clearly overwhelmed by modern classroom requirements. Unable to keep up with online grades or assignments. Fails to grade student assignments by the end of grading periods and ignores them. If, as a parent, you ask about a grade, she'll tell you about how many pieces of paper she has to grade everyday. I get it, it is hard. By not grading assignments she earns an F just like a student would if they did not turn in an assignment. Abrupt with students, parents and administration."
2233,"pretty awful teacher, website is a mess and gives no direction what so ever. also grades very harshly on labs that he expects you to do perfectly. also constantly complains about teaching and tells terrible jokes."
2289,"defensibly the worst teacher ever, she gives you ridiculously hard amounts of work, 20 page packets each week, makes you take notes for 80 minutes straight, labs that aren't even possible to finish fo"
2345,"shes kinda cool but she takes hw assignments as test grades. she was like ""if its not your best work dont turn it in"" to defend herself. i got a C on that ""test"""
2400,loses EVERTHING and makes you redo it. in between misplacing things she talked FOREVER about nothing.
2456,Assigns abundant amounts of irrelevant busywork and aggravating projects that make you question why
2512,"mrs lynn doesnt realize we have other periods and gives too much work, she yells at us when we ask a question and is almost impossible to work with"
2568,Pickering is a juicebag. Funny only if you have a 3rd grade sense of humor. Changes the assignment after you have turned it in. Bring back Patrick Daly.
2624,He doesnt explain the homework so you spend 3 hours triing to figure it out! and he gives you extra homework before the day of the test! Frustersting sometimes.
2680,"Sporadically assigns unclear homework assignments, often contrary to those printed in her homework calendar. Yells at the entire class over trivial matters, which wastes time."
2735,"She is a great person to talk to, but her teaching......is terrible. She assigns way too much homework and her 200 word vocab quizzes, as well as the papers she is yet to grade. By the way she hasn't graded most of our papers yet........ and it's the end of the quarter."
2791,over all a bad teacher you turn some thing in and he loses it and refuses to look again or give you a chance to redo it almost impossible class with the way he teaches.
2847,This woman is possibly the most insipid person I have met. Her homework is pointless. I have a hard time just getting through the instructions.
2903,"She drives me insane! She's mean and she yells alot! And somehow, I get bad grades, no matter how hard I work on them!"
2959,"she tells us we can work on the lab then she yells at us for working on the lab
she is always giving some students extra time and then she yells at others"
3015,unhelpful and forgetful. he is very slow on getting back to you if you ask him to investigate something. waits to update edline until you get a bad grade. save yourself and opt out of his class now!
3071,"She's really sweet, but she's losing it. Almost everyone is on Facebook the night of an assignment trying to figuire out the instructions because she's horribly unclear."
3126,She does not clarify homework assignments and expects too much contributions from parents and not enough from the students. She's supposed to be the teacher.
3182,She sucks as a teacher she will give you a low grade for you work and tell you is wrong but she is so unclear
3238,"he gave homework every single day , is very rude and is very bad at explaining directions . dont recommend for spanish ."
3294,"TAKES HALF THE FREAKING SEMESTER TO GRADE TESTS!!! I had a 96 last week but my real grade could be a 94 or even a 89!!!! Bottom line: If you want to keep your 4.0, don't go to this class. She doesn't teach much, and is very lazy"
3350,Gives way to much homework at some times and none at other. NO balance at all. Though she is nice to talk to. Test are hard and some of the work is hard to understand.
3406,DONT TAKE HER CLASS! almost impossible to get an A. when you spend a lot of time on your work she will still give you a bad grade. ugghh cant stand this class
3461,"doesnt teach anything, assigns tons of work for research between meetings, grades on things she didnt say were criteria"
3517,He gives to much homework waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
3573,Mr. Su is an alright teacher he doesnt get through to most student and this reflects in thier grades he gives 2 many practice Probelms Every Time Every Round
3629,"Tons and tons of homework. If I learned something from it I might have had a different opinion of it, but the homework was pointless. Write as quickly as possible."
3685,All Mr. Mansour does is pick favorites and gives pointless assignments with almost always no due dates on any of them. Definitley one of my least favorite classes.
3741,She gave the worst asignments ever. She made everyone do 100 words of vocabulary do the next day. She is a very nice person though.
3796,she never tells us when things are due.we get 6 assignments all at once.it's not like she's the only class we have.she is soooooooooo boring
3852,Unorganized. Loses papers. Insane! Will go on rampages. Get him talking about something else and you won't have homework.
3908,he doesn't teach.He runs his financial planning business from the class while we do massive amounts of busywork.Never hands out instructions for any assignments expects you to know
3964,"She never checked homework=no grades. And, she would leave class to go talk to others, and never explained, I'M LOST!!!!1"
4020,"Teacher makes own impression instead of class work. Even you can do very well on exam, classwork, homework. He will give you grade according his own rule. He makes participation more than everything else. Even you participate more than others, he will only make his own, not by fact."
4076,"While he doesnt give homework, or at least forgets to, his teaching skills are growing dim. He forgets a lot, changes his information, and he's terribly boring."
4131,"she is so strict but it has no positive effect. i mean, you can't even turn in the hw 2 minutes after she collects it or its late. i missed class and asked if i could come in to have her explain it an"
4187,"Very hard to understand her, she will give labs and not go over them and tell you what to do in them. To be honest I think she is kind of lazy"
4243,"Not good. Class is a waste, and assignments are dumb. If she doesn't like you she'll go out of her way not to give you an A, like writing out your score to the thousandth of a point, so its still a B+"
4299,One of the worst staff members I've worked with. Pushes IB WAY too hard and if you are not an IB student dose not give you the time of day.
4355,she is not too bright... she has had people doing home work in her class and she doeswnt realize it... people can even show her the same home work every single day and she will give you the points
4411,I had him in 6th grade 5 years ago and he was so moody and disorganized. He even forgot to grade our projects and when they were even due!
4466,"Mrs. Biron doesn't teach much. She just assigns homework, gives us class work, and gives us tests. She walks like a penguin too."
