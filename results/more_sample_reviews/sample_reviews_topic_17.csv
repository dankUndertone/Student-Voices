241,"Kenneth Crook is a teacher NOT a professor according to my research so far.
No teaching credentials found....this worries me.
UVU students need degrees to excel in the workplace but UVU hires it's teaching staff based on experience only?"
281,I had high hopes when she came and I've been continually dissapointed. She is unprofessional and leads with fear. She's not the leader she needs to be and the school is sufferning.
322,"I had him in '94-'95, and in 4 years of HS and 4 years of college, one of the WORST teachers I've ever experienced"
362,i cant believe that the district appointed such a nieve woman to direct a high school. even the dumbest students are smarter than her.
402,"Why must you continue to believe that your libralism is so much better than any other political or moral belief? Public schools banned True/False for a reason, Brother."
442,Not a spectacular counselor. Did not help me at all with scholarships or colleges for my field. Only referred me to somewhere else.
483,"I was not prepared for the final exam, my peers in other classrooms were much farther ahead and ultimately, learned much more than I did."
523,"If she thought she was as smart as she thinks she is she'd be great. Apparently, she comes from a long line of exceptional educators. Wow, if she does and if they are any reflection on her teaching and education ability we are in trouble!"
563,NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON STAFFING IN THE WEAK AREAS. Continue to eliminate weak teachers and stress academics not gimics.
603,"I think Ms. Baxter has every intention of helping but is too overwhelmed with her different positions at school, that she forgets that she has offered help in the first place."
644,"Average to less than average. Clearly the kids don't like her at all. They say she is daft and inexperienced, but I like her jokes."
684,"Was very disappointed with his teaching. Our student quickly became disinterested and is simply going through the motions until graduation. Has the potential to be an amazing teacher, but still has a long way to go."
724,"he really should be teaching high school, not 7th. ive been degrated since i walked into that room and have been since."

885,"Mr. Finken, retired in Iowa as a middle school principal, and is often absent or leaving early from his responsibilities from his job. He currently lives in Iowa and has never been a part of the community, let alone our state. He fools some by saying he has a room at Hotel Wilber, or more recently an apartment in Beatrice, but is never seen in those locations. This lack of integrity and work ethic by Mr. Finken has allowed Mr. Uher to run rampant. He has no more integrity than Mr. Uher!!!"
925,"One of the sweetest ladies I have ever met. However, she is incapable of controlling a classroom due to PTSD from an incident with a student a few years ago that resulted in her having a miscarriage. She also isn't very clear in her teaching and does not follow through on the promises about her class she makes at the beginning of the year. We didn't come close to having hw every day and I'm still waiting for the third instalment of ""Element Friday"". Lastly, this is not a ""college prep course"""
966,"Doesn't turn in all college stuff in on time, have to constantly call and email for recommendations, and pushes state schools"
1006,She didn't contact me when I left messages for her and she never returned my emails. I feel that she doesn't make if very clear on how to get an A in her class. Very unclear!
1046,most boring class i ever took. i have difficulty understanding why she was awarded her teaching certificate. -CG
1086,I had her fresman year. My worst year ever. I did not like her. I am sorry for those of you who must suffer in the future.
1127,Gives too much homework and is a total perfectionist. No real science only data tables and graphs. If you get her get a schedule change quick.
1167,"While he claims that his aloofness in his teching style is to help us prepare for college, he must realize that we are NOT college students; we need direction!"
1207,Mr. Board is very disorganized and routinely produces incomplete labs without full sets of results. Students are forced to guess and infer what should happen instead of viewing the actual results.
1247,"i DID graduate three years ago, so perhaps things have changed, but mr. wagner did not teach at all...he was a facilitator. great guy, but what did i learn?"
1288,"worst guidance counselor ever... no help what-so-ever, only thing he did for me was to squash my dreams of going to the college of my choice... told me I wasn´t good enought."
1328,"pretty much a total tool. shes nice and all but thats because shes a ""yes man""...who knows what sides she on. probably the administration because they're the ones paying her 100k salary. this is what public school has become"
1368,"Very disappointed to play ball under this man. When I arrived at Broadneck my Junior year, I was already being prepped as a potential D-1 recruit yet due to his own personal beliefs associated with my life outside of Broadneck, he did not provide me playing time, justification or opportunity. This man was detrimental to my success on the field therefore will continue to hold a negative outlook on his true colors. I therefore quit a game I loved in my senior year!"
1408,Well I saw our iStep scores today and Chesterton rates at the bottom of all the High Schools in Porter Co. (only Portage is lower). If I could change schools I'd go to Valpo.
1449,"Mr. Perone always has been, is a hypocritical, self-glorifier. So, the world has already been saved? Not until people like you are stopped..."
1489,A bumbling bungler of a man. The mere mention of his name produces chuckles from the students for a reason.
1529,"Doesn't understand how the school system works. Bad at teaching. Unconsiderate... Easy course, though."
1569,Hated her. Bitter? Yes. Clarity? I've had much better by far. To never see her again made graduation all the more satisfying.
1610,Mrs. Christen has done nothing what so ever to help this school. She is ruining franklin as we know it. I feel sorry for the next generation.
