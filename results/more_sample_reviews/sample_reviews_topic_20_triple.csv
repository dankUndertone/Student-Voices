212,he is a very mean teacher.he'll take away any mechanical pencils in art.now my finger is huge.....x[(from using a wood pencil.)

335,"Does not appreciate greatness, or for that matter eccentricity. Does not understand History is diverse in its intepretation. Should read textbook, and you will be alright."

369,She doesn't accept any opinion but hers. Proving her wrong is impossible in her eyes. Not very fun or flexible with her units. SWITCH OUT NOW.
