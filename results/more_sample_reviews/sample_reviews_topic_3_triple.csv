107,"I don't think he really knows what he's talking about. He understands the language, but he really can't teach it. He dosn't relate to his students very well, either."

430,"Harshest grader ever... Cannot relate to the students.. You can learn alright spanish but just wow... He has more subs than actually teaching, says ""WHY HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED THIS YET?"" (Not knowing we haven't even learned it yet..)"
484,"when he does his little ""motivation speeches"" he real needs to not use so much southern slang, cuz i don't know half the things hes saying."
538,He made me hate spanish...he dont know how to teach...but he is very smart and knows alot on almost everything exept teaching...
592,don't know how anyone could say she knows her stuff since she is not even competent in the material in Spanish I.
646,"well, she teaches us how to write english letters in class and she cant speak english. i understand her mandarin better than her english."
699,Ms. Giloni knows her stuff but she can't teach it to students. She would have been much better off as a scientist then a teacher.
753,"Mr. Bux u dont know how to teach, u think ur funny but aren't and u forget what u really have to do. TEACH!"
807,He has to lean how to be a better listener and learn how to relate to his students more so that they listen to him more.

1399,"SMC is a nice person, but not if you want help with anything or need something done by a deadline. Also, she sometimes speaks slowly, as if we can't understand."

1615,she doesnt realize we cant speak spanish. and she is snotty sometimes. needs to be cooler. we dont learn anything.
1669,I think she is very unreasonable. I don't not think she understands that this is only Highschool and I have 6 other classes that I have homework for. She needs to understand that my life does not revolve around her. She needs to either go back to AP English or calm down because this is ridiculous.
1722,some love the way she teaches other dont its as simple as that i dont think a learned very much if anything in her german class but i know people that do

3768,"HE DOESN'T TEACH US! EVERYDAY HE SAYS ""THIS SHOULD BE REVIEW SO I DONT NEED TO TEACH THIS."""
