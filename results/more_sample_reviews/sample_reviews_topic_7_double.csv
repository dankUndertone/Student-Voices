2392,"Instead of teaching the material in class he will spend most of the period going over homework while other people sleep. Then he will constantly attack you for not going to tutoring and/or missing homework. Very exasperating and dull, he just does not realize that what goes on in the classroom is just as, if not more, important then what goes on at home."
2451,"She clearly knows a lot about Chemistry, but since she spends most of her time talking about her family, personal life, or how students are lazy, not much ever gets across. Avoid if at all possible."

3528,i switched classes after 2 weeks....doesnt teach at all...we ended up teaching our selves because she doesnt know what to do...also she tells lots of personal stories that no one wants to hear
3588,Probably the most pretentious person I've ever met. Spends more time talking about his vacation to Italy then anything else. Still very easy course work you could spit in his face everyday and still get a B-.
3647,"One of the worst teachers I ever had. All she did was talk, talk, talk, about how much she loves our class, then yells at us for asking questions. I'm glad this year is over!"

3767,er.. hes rele weird. yeah. and no one likes him at all and he makes us do totally pointless things that dont relate to the unit.
3827,"Don't take his class if you take the subject seriously, because he doesn't. I had him for sociology, and yes he's funny but I didn't learn a thing. He talks about himself the whole time. Not good."

4006,i hate this guy he cant teach for the life of it and calls people out makes us feel like absolute garbage. spend more time teaching and less time talking about food and videogames
4066,i can't believe this woman is teaching kids. she is very emotional. She talks down to the kids and yells when they ask a question to be repeated
4126,"Not the greatest teacher. Talks about track, football, and goes way off topic to much so we dont get much done. Cool guy and pretty hilarious so class is at least entertaining but very unproductive."
4186,"i have to say, he didnt teach at all. all we did was read the book in class and do the homework. no structure, didnt know what he was talking about, not much help either."
4245,She's okay...annoying how she comes to school sick all the time then tells us not to come when we're sick...also gets off track easily. But Spanish 4 is easy.
4305,"he makes jokes, but i dont really think its funny i just go along with it(he says jokes over and over again)"
4365,"I'm taking History 1. Every day he writes the instructions on the board, so you can grab a worksheet. The thing is, he'll start talking, and he just. won't. stop. Says he's going to talk for 5 minutes, ends up doing 15 minutes. exaggerates unnecessarily on things like font size, font, and assignment value/length. You can take the assignment for the day and be done with it before he's done talking. Use the period for something actually important. Have fun tuning him out, he'll never stop."
4425,"This guy is hilarious! he doesn't try to be, but being in this class will give you some great moment."
4485,"This teacher is very strict and does not enjoy small talk. I once tried to say hello and all I got a death stare. She does not take socializing lightly and will keep a very silent class room. DO NOT get this teacher, AVOID!!!!!!!!!"
4544,"She's nice from time to time, but the woman has no idea how to run a classroom and she picks favorites. It's freaking annoying."
4604,Has no control over her class. Talks way too much about her kids and husband. Reading off a power point is not teaching.
4664,When she talks does her voice seem to droan on and on forever or is it just me? She wore the purple outfit today...if you have ever had her you know that one.
4724,"you're a great teacher and all, but all of us get tired of doing the same thing every single day, i think we need a free day every now and then, instead of work"
4784,"Mr. Large is the worst teacher ever! He talks in a voice no one can hear nor understand. He gives people detention for no reason. For example, while doing our work, he told the class we could talk. So, everyone was talking and he comes up to me and my friends tells us that we're talking talking about something science related and gave us a detain even though no one was talking about anything science related! If you get his class, I suggest you switch out of it...fast! Not one student likes him!"
