3714,she assues that since we are an honors geometry class- we already know everything and that she doesnt need to teach us-which is completely wrong -learn to teach
3795,She teaches French and Spanish and is probably one of the worst teachers I've ever encountered. I don't really know how to even describe her level of stupidity. It takes some endurance to takeherclass

4603,she might be a bit better teaching college students. she doesn't seem to have the right patience for high school kids
4684,She keeps yelling in class and it annoys the crap out of me. She knows the stuff but when she teaches its not understandable

5491,she is one of those teachers that wont teach you a thing and expect you to go out of your way to learn from videos online with mass amounts of homework better off just not even showing up.
5572,i think ms G is the most uneducated teacher i have ever had plus she is over her head trying to teach us how she does. she is way to unorganzied and cannot hold on to students work
5653,ughh..learn how to teach!!! no more videos!! sorry but i cant learn about the middle ages by watching the holy grail!
