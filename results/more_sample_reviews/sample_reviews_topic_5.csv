115,You don't seem to really care about what your teaching and it sometimes seems like all you want to do is get class overwith...how am i supposed to want to be there??
231,scariest teacher i ever had- made me scared to raise my hand. He made fun of kids. YAWW DAVIS go to angermanegment
346,"He wasn't a very good teacher. He's an okay guy but he's always picking on certain kids and never helps his students. Plus, he's very unorganized."
462,she is mean and tries her hardest to make her students feel bad about themselves. She made me feel so stupid I wanted to cry.
577,"didnt like her, moody, makes up things right on the spot, and was late to class every morning... happy she is gone"
693,Unfortuntely Mrs.Fesseden does not know how to react with kids.If she did students would like her.Her class wasn't exactly a place I enjoyed learning in.
808,our class is always disorderly with people getting off task...shouldn't have taken this class at all...
924,yo shez like mean..be makin fun of kidz and then she be like treating some kids nicely and some kids mean.....thats call racism....like come on......we're all the same.......
1039,"Pick favorites, always has an attitude and you are the rudiest teacher ever. So who should put forth more effort?"
1155,I have a really hard to talk to Mrs.Moody. I just feel like she is judging me when I try to talk to her. I don't feel like I can talk to her... Sorry.
1270,he sound like he teachers kindergarten or somethin...so weird so imature and seems like he has nothing in his brain
1386,"He just wants to be everybody's friend, so kids don't respect him much. I did not learn much."
1501,"She is the worst! She is a control freak in some ways and doesn't take control where she needs to! She is only nice to the students she likes. And hey, how about a smile once in a while?"
1617,"Mrs. Faszewski is a bad teacher. All she did was put me down. I was an athlete and I always tried hard in her class, yet she never respected me. She'll only like you if your are physically challenged."
1732,"Mr Dyal enjoys making my child and others feel very unappreciative. These kids need to feel apart of something, not yelled at."
1848,"Worst teacher ever. Hates students. Has ridiculously high expectations of sophomore work, yet treats 15-year-olds like 5 year olds... also flips out if you're wearing scented lotion."
1963,"She treats the class like 5-year-olds, and is surprised when they act like it. She seems like a nice person, but not an excellent teacher. Unclear explanations--i'm always confused"
2079,"If a kid does something ridiculously stupid, like pull out cigarettes on campus, he doesn't come down hard enough, but for things like using phones in the call after ABCD lunch, he gave detentions. ??"
2194,"She has almost no authority. It seems like she could be a lot more helpful if she wasn't scared of us (i think she actually knows a lot about art)BTW, this ISN'T a bird class.HARD"
2310,"I really don't like his assemblies, the jokes are bad and the ""cheer"" is dumb. He also is an incompetent teacher."

2541,she likes to scream alot when nobody is doing anything at all!!!! if she doesnt hate you your going to get a 100.
2656,"She would act like my best friend sometimes, and other times would pretend she'd never even spoken to me. Just not a very nice person in general."
2772,"if you like to sleep and daydream, he's the teacher for you. or if you like mushy sayings he's your man. don't get me started."

3003,this is her first year teaching at valhalla and i feel like im back in kindergarten when im in her classroom.
3119,he is a teacher he feels like he has to prove something by arguing and giving detentions. He is the type of teacher he worrys more about how kids respect him and act then what they actually learn
3234,"Terrible. So full of herself, even though she has the worst skin condition I have ever seen. She just likes to control everything and everyone, and is so fake"
3350,"If the class if called drawing, then why are we doing photography and painting and building props...? Plus teacher is very moody. Did not enjoy one bit."

3581,"She always looks over my shoulder to see if I'm paying attention. It gets really annoying, because it makes me uncomfortable. If I know the subject, then I'm drawing! So what if I don't pay attention, I don't like math! In general! But her as a person, she's pretty nice."
3696,He has no idea what life is like for students these days and all he does is take away all the rights we have and make high school even more miserable. He is uptight and not open to any sort of fun.
3812,"I dont know what u think, but I think that he doesnt treat kids good enough. U are too rought. If a kid is late for 5 seconds, u mark him late and unprepeared"
3927,"She is like the grinch, you cannot smile with out getting written up, and nobody really cares that much. She thinks it is harder than it is."
4043,"She seems like she doesnt know what she is teaching. She is funny and likes to make jokes with the class, but is incapable of helping a student and sometimes makes students feel clueless"
4158,"She doesn' even use a textbook which makes it hard to keep up. I hate her class and she doesn't care about any of her students. Not to mention our UCP class is above the Honors, and she is way top tryhard. Don't reccomend her, I feel you if you get her :("
4274,"One of the worst teachers I ever had, didn't like me from the first day, and she really doesn't think students should play sports and school at the same time. HORIBBLE!!!!!!!!!!!"
4389,"it's only been one week of this class, and i already know it's going to be a long semester. i'm a senior and i feel like i'm being treated like i'm in sixth grade. like really with these million rules"
