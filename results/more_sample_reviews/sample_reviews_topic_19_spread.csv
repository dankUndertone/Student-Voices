713,"History is hi-STORY, not daily boring class set activities, videos from Schlessinger, giving homework questions found in the textbook word for word, and getting tested on obscure material on page 423 1/2 of the textbook. He is the laziest teacher I have ever met. He uses a test generator, he copies and pastes homework questions from the book, and he gives class sets so he doesn't have to re-pass out boring activities that he says are ""going to be great!"" -.- I hate Mr. Small...."
727,Mr. Bertani's tiny handwriting is just an excuse to get away with writing Van Halen lyrics as lesson plans. AP History was an absolute joke.

807,Obsessed with taking notes. She won't even answer questions if you don't show your notes first. Gives tests over notes. Worst teacher at OHS. MEAN.

875,"When he gives us HW, the references to page numbers don't even match up, he's boring and his class is really hard."
888,mr brandts class is a waste of money luckily he got fired tho he doesnt know anything about science or teaching and all we do is take notes that are copied strait from the text

996,"Ms.Palermo does not actually teach. Everyday, we take notes that she directly copies onto the powerpoint for the students to copy and barely goes over the homework. We barely spend enough time on one section for the students"
1009,Had her for science once... The class was very misguided. Not to mention that I was unintentionally flashed on daily occasions.
1023,"he has tons of time cus he only teaches 4 classes. his bugdet is way too big. he has like 4 comps an expensive projecter, bose system and a mix board never use"
1036,Mr. Gustin has very little knowledge beyond the absolute bare minimum. He reads the power points word for word to the class and typically evades any questions by rephrasing the question back to the class. He has outright admitted that he doesn't read the notes before class. He has a false sense of entitlement. He gets all of his tests from online and has no idea what's on them. I honestly would be better off if I had no teacher at all in that class.
1050,"She described my son's Alan Parson's Project as being ""wildly inappropriate"" and took points off for things that made no sense, but when I asked for a copy of the performance she essentially refused."
1063,she give's too many reading comprehensions and too many facts to write..how about teaching the chapter for once
1077,where to start. she has a horrible grading system. we do like 30 assignments and then we have a binder check and all she does is see if we did them. her homework consists of reading passages and REWRITING WORD FOR FREAKIN WO

1131,"she is a homework center teacher, and she is suppost to help me with essay writing, but i just get bored, and she doesnt teach anything usefull"
1144,"Mrs Brownson should not be a photo. teacher at all. When going into this course I though we were going to learn a lot about how to use photoshop, cameras, and photography. But at the end of the semester I haven't learned anything due to the fact that my teacher know nothing about photography at all. Even with my little knowledge of how to use Photoshop it I know more than her (which is expected because she can barley use her computer). Also during class we do nothing because she doesnt give us a"
1157,I was in ap computer science and her Visual Basic class. She teaches out of a textbook from the looks of it. And still fails to be correct when she explains things. Corrected her on many occasions. She never gave notes or tought a thing or gave notes
1171,"made us take pages of notes about evry day, then took tests the next day, which evrybody failed. took pages of notes on project procedures, 1 time, we had 2 grow a plant using birdseed, rocks, dirt+water. day after notes he asked us how he thinks we will do the project, but we did not no what we were to do until last day. i read aloud procedure notes. he said that they might have been correct and that wed just have 2 ""guesstimate"" and ""observate"" always used improper grammar. he was distracting"
1184,mrs clemmer is one of the worst math teachers i've ever had. she'll write the info up on the board and wont explain it. i'm better off teaching myself the info.
1198,He loves mispronouncing words and using words she doesnt know the meaning of. It makes her look very intelligent as a principal.
1211,"She is the worst history teacher you could have.
She has favorites and shows them plainly.
SHe makes us read out of hte book and outline
or copy down notes
the whole 1 hour period
we learn nothing"
1225,I'm not sure if Mrs. O'Sullivan could actually do the problems she assigned in my accounting 320 class. She NEVER did the problems step by step and relied on reading power-point word for word during her lecture. Really helpful. Not.
1238,Don't let Fournier dazzle you with her diagrams and literal explanations. The woman couldn't tell you more about biology than a three year old could.
1252,Most everything he knows about computers and programming is useless. Randomly and consistently goes off on tangents that are unrelated to the subject matter.
1265,"Absolute WORST teacher. Never teaches,instead forces us to copy down slides from random powerpoints she gets off the internet for hw,and doesn't even post them till the day they're due.During class,either makes us do busywork completely irrelevant to the PPs,or makes us endure boring videos that people actually have fallen asleep to.When she DOES ""teach"",she tells us more random info. Honestly, I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be learning in biology b/c she has the ciriculum so screwed up."
1279,"Mrs. Lepkofker is a terrible teacher. Instead of teaching, she 'babysits'. If anything she's more like a long-term sub. She hardly ever teaches us the material, but instead makes sure we've learned it by giving quizzes. She's resorted to video notes which is her reading off the textbooks or a powerpoint she didn't make. The video notes are mandatory homework assignments. In class, we constantly do worksheets or ""labs"". Labs are just more worksheets but sometimes there's water involved."
1292,I did not learn anything from his class. The only time I learned is when I went to tutorial at Ms. Harper's class. He didn't even assign homework from the book; instead he used obscure methods and a different book that no one even had. I could have learned more from just going through the book by myself.
1306,"Had a difficult time in this class. Teaches by writing examples on the board and working through them, but does not explain his thought process. I had to watch many videos and use the book on my own to learn the content. Hard to keep up."
1319,she never goes over the hw or ANYTHING..and i hate taking notes off the computer she doesnt type it good like that just do it on the board jeez!
1333,"Her idea of a fill in the blank problem is copy a sentance from the text book and remove something like it, the, at. Totally serious. Get out of her class!"
1346,"Mr. Fleenor teaches my digital electronics (engineering) class. I never knew teaching engineering could get even worse than how Shreiner does, but Fleenor takes the (awful) cake. Mr Fleenor's voice is so silent and raspy I can't barely hear what he says. To compensate for verbal lecture, he instead makes all of us read confusing powerpoint presentations in order to even remotely understand the mountains of worksheet contents he's thrown at us. This is not how you teach engineering."

1373,The laziest professor even please don't take him. If I put myself now to write about his teaching it will be more that a novel but in a negative way. Such a bad teacher????
1400,"Too much energy. Encourages students to ""play the game"". Basically, do what everybody tells you to do and write what the teacher wants to read."
1427,"Doesn't know how to use technology. Anything she says that is not part of the slideshow that she uses, which is provided by the book's publisher, is completely false."
1454,"she almost falls asleep during fast math, is constantly critisizing us, and teaches in the worst way by writing notes on the board."
1481,"he spent two whole class periods showing us how to write properly using a pencil, and another couple of days showing us the proper use of a ruler.. lame-o"
1508,She is not a good teacher she fustrates every single student and doesnt know very much about computers.Students know more than she does about most computer prog.
1535,Too based on textbook and doesn't teach well... all his tests are based on pages you have to assume to read...nice guy though
1561,mr.c is cool and all but should teach computers. and should let us use the restroom when wwe want to wheter or not it is before a lecture or not. and stop si
1588,"I am a parent and have been reviewing my child's Geophysical Sciences class. This teacher is a major error. Her powerpoints are consistently riddled with errors, contradictory, and not explanatory. I hear that she refuses to teach students even after they have tried their best. Her favorite phrase is ""Read it again."" Instead of inspiring she demoralizes. Her exams are obscure and do not reflect what a student understands or learns. What a waste of time and minds."
1615,CLASS CAN BE EASSY MAYBE IF I WERE U I WOULD READ THE OTHER STUFF PPL WROTe doesnt mae sence to write it again
1642,"She reads directly off her slides as if what she's teaching to us is new to her too, she uses crash course to teach, and often had the answers on her test mixed up or wrong."
1669,"Between spelling out words on the spelling test, food packs, and letting us out late, I can't belive I am saying it, but I actually miss Mr. Z, Eshe is giving me a migraine.."
1696,"He just reads you the section out of the book, or makes you read it and he's like ok get started kids. That class is so easy and boring, and he yells at you for no reason i hate it"
1723,he is available four times outside of school and there is a line to talk to him. He literally downloads all of his powerpoints from the interweb
1750,i take notes everyday too! that's the only way i can ace it except for like readintg the book like 5 million times and taking 10 pages of notes! (really ! that's what i did on the chapter 5 test!) has favorites he's preety cool though. i hate his sarcasm.
1777,"wow, her class was very difficult, but interesting. ""did you read this??"" <--she'll write that on the bottom of your reading tests if you do really bad. but, i do miss her........"
1804,She read off a powerpoint 10% of the time and gave you 10 packets a day for the other 90%. I rate 0/8 if i could.
1831,"She thinks she's a math teacher but she's not. I thought in COMPUTER class we would learn editing softwares and programs, but it's just MORE MATH!! all we do is study island and research reports for other subjects that she doesn't teach"
1858,"No Mr. Riley, I will not take out my notebook, I will not take out my folder. He's like 95, about time he gets outa the teaching game."
1885,She isn't very bright ....what a waste of time! We know more than her about science! -----Can't they hire a good science teacher?
1912,"she really should be more involved, make up the homweork, work problems with us, give examples. she leaves the teaching to the book and the worksheets that came with the book"
1938,An out-dated hippie who doesn't know how to get her point across and doesn't know how to get the class to follow her. She's so cool. She loves Mr. Spock.
1965,"I am sincerely tired of Mrs. Waters giving us lazy busy work. Her assignments have little to nothing to do with animation, and from what I hear her third year students dont do anything useful either. We are now in the month of November and none of her classes has done any animating. All of the software cost about $18,000. We havent used them once."
1992,"OK Very nice but so irregular in grading. She tells you not to copy out of the book, but when you do you get 100 and when you don't you fail. and she wants you to read her mind."
2019,"Campion is the champion of the do nothings and the want to do more of the same fame, which makes most of these type of lazy teachers popular for some reason."
2046,I had him for Computer Programming 1 and i really like the class and how it is structured but he did not teach us very much. We had to learn how to code completely on our own and he most of the time gave us the code sheets to copy off of. He is a nice guy but he will get mad at you for no reason even though you have all of the work done.
2073,"In her own words ""I don't know how to code java, go look it up."" She is incompetent and smug. Some friends of mine don't do the assignments and instead copy and paste the instructions into the entry box. They get higher grades than those that do the work. She chooses to not learn her material, and she penalizes people that do. She prepares nothing herself, instead finding videos online of other teachers reading their own PowerPoints verbatim. If you want an easy A free period, take her classes."
2100,"He's a knowledgeable person, but not a good teacher. He's constantly embarrassing students, and doesn't help them at all. He doesn't really teach, just makes you write notes as he flips through a PowerPoint."
2127,"He teaches with a lot of energy, but the problem is 98 percent of what he says is either unclear, or conflicting. He rounds your grade up if your a football player and/or he likes you. He also doesn't really read what you write he just skims. With that said, don't make you writing sound good, just get in the key facts and phrases."
2154,Kathryn Ballard has a very interesting teaching method. She has her students read in textbooks the whole 42 minutes and take guided notes by filling in the blanks of sentences and such. Then she expects her 12 year old students to learn and know what they're writing every single day. She is an extremely strict and picky grader and expects everyone to write perfectly and explain each sentence. She gives tests with 31+ vocabulary words and 8 possible short answer questions. It's a bit extreme.
2181,"By far the worst teacher I've ever had. She just copies down notes onto a sheet of paper on the projector, and doesn't even give students enough time to copy down what she writes, much less understand or think about it. Struggles to answer any intuitive questions that students ask, and always leaves a lot of students confused."
2208,"As my child said, she applies too much pressure on the students. Melanie, apparently, makes the students write an entire section of notes a day, which are usually 6 to 9 pages. Her way of explaining was not clear like her notes, and she expects too much from her students."
2235,"Aight. She doesn't know anything. She gets Powerpoints off the internet (I know that because she told us) and just reads directly off of them. She shows no comprehension of World History, to a point where when she tries to lecture us without a powerpoint, she trails off and reads out of the book. We only learn through self teaching with these BS projects about subjects we don't discuss in class.We get those on the regular. I fail to see why she is aloud to teach at a school rated #1 in Nevada."
2262,"His lessons are incredibly boring and confusing. He writes ""vague"" on virtually anything you hand in to him. One of the worst science teachers one could ask for."
2289,"One of the laziest teachers I have ever had. Every assignment is stolen from someone else online. Whenever she is co-teaching, she either sits around and does nothing, or reads verbatim off of her co-teacher's notes. Does not know anything, obviously never makes lesson plans, and is incredibley condescending to everyone. If you see that you have her, drop the class."
2315,Doing oral reports she'd be on her computer typing she's not very nice or encouraging. Very boring her dog ann is cool though
2342,She was only worried with rockets and bill nye nothing else that had to do with science because of her i have to take general biology in high school
2369,"Just plain bad. Avoid at all costs. Her tests are amazingly hard, to the point where it seems to cover things you have't studied. She will NOT help you in any way shape or form and the syllabus is basically her ""can't help ya out"" Book. No power points, just scribbled half legible writing on the board. Good luck with that. Let me reiterate, AVOID her at all costs."
2396,"Mrs Nadeau has no idea what she's doing. What we see on our tests, a good 70% was never even in our notes. She can't even be bothered to make her own slides, she just rips them off another history teacher and can't teach us well because she has no idea what she's talking about because she didn't even write the notes she's giving us. She's nice but she should not be a teacher. Totally useless."
2423,"To begin with, Mrs. Waxenfelter forced us to write cornell notes the exact way she wanted us to even if it didn't work for us. Furthermore, she made us write summaries that were 5 sentences long for every page of notes with five transition words which flowed awfully. Continually, whenever we asked a question she said ""Yeah, you got it"" and avoided answering, leaving us confused. Finally, Her assignments in second semester took several hours to complete on weekends, don't get me started on WW2."
2450,What is with the mirror on her computer? She is not real nice. Science isn't fun cuz we can't do the experiments she does them all.
2477,"I have her for AB Calculus and she is not very clear when teaching the material. I can tell she is just copying down a pre-written note template onto a blank piece of paper. We spend the first 15 minutes learning the material and the rest of the hour doing nothing. Mrs. Garg's AB Calculus class is challenging, but not for the reasons it should be."
2504,Yells at students for asking questions. Notes are copied from book - nothing new to look at. Tests not like class.
2531,"Reluctant to give extra help. Has an attitude if approached with q's. Will not post work on Smartboard to Blackboard.Does not prepare lessons in advance, so must take up class time writing lesson plan"
2558,"Don't often write reviews but Didelot is by far the worst teacher I have had in my life. In her AP Stat class, she does not know the material that she is supposed to ""teach"". I once asked her a question on her own test and she had to look in the textbook for the answer to my question (on her own test!!). She doesn't teach, uses meaningless power points, and overuses the textbook to the point where coming to class seems like a waste of time. I am shocked she is eligible to teach at Staples."
2585,Mrs.pablo Martinez is a overall bad teacher she eats in class and for example she wrote through and told me to read and when i read the word through she said its though And she acts as if she has never heard anyones use one cuss word and will email your parents as if its a big deal and will make you do achieve even though other classes do not do achieve so overall she is a bad teacher in general TRY TO SWITCH CLASSES
2612,He buys so many things for his class and basically wastes the schools budget. He's gotten racks 3D printers and stations of flight simulators. Now you think this is cool but wait there's more.... YOU DONT GET TO USE THEM!!! It's like he uses it them for himself or to let others see how cool his room is. Also his lessons are mad long and confusing and don't serve any purpose. His sarcasm is the worst making you feel like you can't do the task.
2639,"Ms.Evers- or Ms.Nevers, as I privately call her, is a lazy excuse for a teacher who didn't show half the time last year. Now she does, but complains about the tiniest things(pen!) and makes us work in the textbook too much, when we do ""hands on"" we spend 3 days copying her handwriting into nb ( PROCEDURE!!!) does not admitt to any mistakes, is a horrible teacher who does not even acknowledge her students waving to her in the hallway; my friend transferred to private school because of her."
2666,"he kicks students out for no reason and doesn't even help them make up the work that they missed when they were kicked out. he doesn't explain the work to us at all, and when we ask for clarification; he sends you out. when we ""take notes"", we aren't even taking notes. he writes out problems and does them but doesn't give us anything to look back at that is in words, just writing a problem down and solving it isn't doing anything except preparing us for failure."
