558,I don't like Mr. Rink. He is to hard he favors students and he picked on me because I didn't practice the clarinet.
585,she does not talk to students. it is obvious that she likes some more than others and grades according to who she likes

931,"He dosent listen to his students. All he cares about is stupid jazz music and his jazz band. Coming from Fuhrmann, Mott's band is just stupid. Its no wonder why a lot of students end up dropping band."

1037,"She is not a very good teacher and plays extreme favorites on certain people. When choosing people for the play/musical she closes the ones that can help her the most ranging from who can provide money for it to who can build things for the set. She never actually chooses on real talent as seen in her last musical, she choose someone since their mom could provide the the theater department with funding. Overall I think she is unfair and in general a bad teacher. Would not recommend!"
1064,She totally chose favorites and hated anyone who deny agree with her or who wasn't in cheer

1250,from a person who doesnt talk alot i noticed that mr. ross is extremely unfair to some students who act no differently then the rest of the class. he needs to be more fair
1277,"shes nice, but don't be fooled. she has a sneaky way of playing favorites and loves to get kids in a lot of trouble"

1357,Probably my least favorite teacher Sophomore year and definitely my least favorite history teacher ever.
1383,"Blair is the problem with our music program at LC. I had her for orchestra and she is the reason I stopped doing something I loved. Can't even compare her to Bart (sac teacher). I got worse, not better, throughout the year. Good at choir, bad at orchestra."
1410,In my experience Valdez is a teacher who clearly plays favorites with her students and even with certain instruments. She does not develop musical theory skills and spends most of her time getting off topic and telling stories.

1596,"i dislike her sooo much! she plays favorites and makes the non-favorites cry, and when they're crying, she yells at them more!she does'nt belong in a classroom!"
1623,"Her peso system is frustrating. Basically you need 5 pesos for the vocal part of your test. The way to get these pesos is to participate. I'm fine with this idea but she executed this process in the worst way possible. She picks the same students over and over again and even if you do participate, you only have a 20% chance of getting a peso. I don't care about her singing, but letting only a select few students get called on for peso questions everyday is unfair and biased. Worst teacher so far"
1649,"loves to kick out like 7 of us and yell, can't play sorts and play bad grades o yeh CLASS AVERAGE A F cause she carsabout us playin even if everyoneparticipate"
1676,"He hates technology. And he plays favorites. The better he likes you the higher grade you'll get, if he doesn't like you then well good luck."
1703,"She has favorites, yells at people for no good reason and can't conduct. The songs she picks out for class are terrible, we do the same exact thing every day."
1729,Mrs. Sandoval runs the theater department based on favoritism. If you are not one of her favorites don't expect to get roles. Favorites are determined by being friends with prior favorites. This has led to a system of cliques and cattiness in the theater.People who get roles think they are superior to everyone and their talent is overpraised. If you are in a higher level theater class and don't get a part you won't learn anything. She is emotionally manipulative. Do Communit theater instead
1756,mr sutherland thinks hes the best teacher but all he does is tell stories about himself. he only pretends to take an interest in the kids and leaves out certian students. dont play favorites.
1782,"he is a good teacher but he is very sarcastic. he will put you down if he doesnt like what you did. in theatre he complains a lot.he favored his students, those who are in theatre and help out."
1809,"If you like to sing and perform do not take her class. The performances are lame that Elementary Schools have better performances. She gives you a music history paper to write because she needs to fill up time because there is no performances to work towards. She is confusing and not a very nice person. If you like to sing, then just do it on your own and join a church choir."
1836,"Ms. Najar is a terrible teacher! She is mean, and nasty, and horrible! She chooses favorites and they are mostly made up of the quiet ones!"
1862,"Heath is good only if she likes you and you are one of her top kids. If not you are left alone, and she is mean. plays favorites."

1915,The IB kids seem to like him but he talks down to and degrades the orchestra kids. He is also very unfair and makes bad song choices. He also has little to no respect for his two lower orchestras and
1942,"everyone sophomore will love vento for her wittiness and strong personality.Definitely whips you into shape when writing an essay and is very good at her job. Overall if you have the chance to take her class, go for it, but in my opinion there are downsides. She makes it very obvious that she has favorites, extremely obvious, and it is fact that she gives into highschool drama which is very innapropraite and frankly annoying, definitely not a favorite teacher due to her snootiness as well."
1969,"Ew definitely the worst muscal theatre teacher ever.She didnt care what we wanted to do for Broadway Bound, she just picked the worst show in theatre's history.She taught me nothing.I hate that woman!"
1995,"hate her... so obvious favorites... when she picks on you to answer, before you can answer, she says NO and picks someone else!!1"
2022,"Didn't try to know the students. Would pick song choices on his own, didn't take input to what we prefer. Fun class, but not necessarily because of him."
2048,"He thinks he's all that, but he's not. He likes to blame and pick on certain students b/c his bands do so bad. That's why he loses so many good players."
2075,"completely unfair and picks favorites. if you are not one of her favorites, she picks on and insults you. very very mean. if you do one thing wrong, she will scream at you and embarass you on purpose."

2182,he definately chooses favorites in all his classes and continuously makes fun of his students especially about their test grades in front of the class.
2208,"talks to much, plays favorites to no end and the funniest part is that none of his favorites like him. I don't like him much either simply because he always picks on me and makes it perfectly clear what he thinks of me"
2235,"Marlys is the WORST educator I've ever come into contact with. She says one thing, does another. Is inconsistent, unfair, and plays favorites BIG TIME."
2261,Ms Mitchell is so unfair. She treats all of her students very unequally. She plays favoritism a lot!! She will most likely pick over Caucasian people over any other race. I've been in so many situations in which she would let students from other classes turn in their work late and then when it comes to me she would just give me a direct no. If you're going to be a teacher at least be fair. Not to mention how unorganized she is.
2288,"great conductor, but, but not that great teacher. He is biased toward jazz band and talks way too much. Tho i've had worse teachers, I wouldn't say that he's one of the better ones."
2315,"Mostly nice but its kinda fake, you can feel she is fake and she can get kinda bad tempered, definately has favorites :\"
2341,"tonette is an awesome sub. :)i especially like her music, i.e. ""how do i look it doesn't matter!"" have you ever heard her play that song??? she rocks."

2448,I'm in orch. and Mr. Arizzi is a band teacher teaching orch. It makes for a bad experience please bring back Mr. Schnabel.
2474,definitely one of the worst teachers i've ever had. she played favorites and was SO biased. sometimes she had no idea what she was talking about and contradicted herself.
2501,"Mr. Brooks plays favorites, and does not let the students do anything but watch. I like Mr. Earle, he lets everybody participate."
2527,"If you don't think the way SHE thinks, she will fail you. She also has obvious favorites and obvious people that she hates. She is not good teacher material."
2554,Econ was a joke. I could have learn more from a sub than this man. He loves his football players and cheerleaders but everyone else is left out.
2581,ya she dose have a computer obsession. she gives us music that on a kupple days before were gonna play it at a CONCERT!! mood swings defintly.
2607,"He is quite possibly one of the worst teachers I have ever had. English used to be my favorite subject, but now that I have him as a teacher i dread it. He thinks he explains stuff clearly but never does, and he has favorites. It's quite obvious if you aren't a favorite, bc your grades will be absolute crap. Don't even try to disagree with him or your grade will go down the drain. Your writing will become his because otherwise you don't get a good grade. I do not reccomend him at all"
2634,"pfff if your serious about band you'll go to pomona. band at Standley is less than average. mr reed, you are too uptight."
2661,Not that great of a teacher. She plays favorites. She's so oblivious to everything that goes on. And changes grading scales when her favorites don't do too well.
2661,Not that great of a teacher. She plays favorites. She's so oblivious to everything that goes on. And changes grading scales when her favorites don't do too well.
2714,Bad teacher. She expected us to learn about 2 sections a day and barely went over problems with us. And she totally plays favorites.
2767,He doesn't help you if your not smart. He only cares about his pet students and gives them candy for the test. HOW LAME!
2820,Mr. G teaches very little music to the lower band. It's an easy 'A' -- basically show up with your music and fog a mirror. But we don't learn anything.
2873,She picks on the good athletes.And doesn't let them have any fun also she has very little knowledge on certain sports
2927,Bad grading system if you're weak in history. He favors the smart kids and doesn't help the weak ones. Bad news here.

3565,"She can not teach and she has attitude with her student, my least favorite teacher"
3618,"Clearly a knowledgeable and enthusiastic history teacher, but blatant misandry is not classroom appropriate. Plays favorites, attacks certain students for minor mistakes."
3672,i hope you will stop the favortism before it causes alot of turmoil. you need to change and im pretty sure everyone else would agree also.
3725,"worst teacher ever and gave me a c and showed me my grades and they were 90,91,87,92 she should quit now"

IF I HAD A BETTER TEACHER I WOULD STILL BE DOING BAND. BUT THEY TELL YOU ALL THAT MATTERS IS BAND AND THEY EVEN MAKE KIDS CRY! THEY ARE SUPER STRICT, BORING, MEAN AND AWFUL.

3885,"She was a very unhelpful, mean, uncaring teacher. She played favorites, and the students not in her favor were treated like dirt."
3938,horrible teacher!!!! Assigns busy work constantly. Plays favorites like no ones business. Just awful in general.
3991,"She has way too many favorites and doesn't know any of the people's names. She makes totally ranom edits that are opinion, not fact."
4044,"NEVER interacted with students, boring. Says 'through' waaay too much. Hated on the smart kids that outdid the ones who donated $$$ to the school. Has favorites, doesn't care for the others."
4097,"I had an open mind at the beginning of the year, but he barely reads music, can't keep a steady beat, can't play piano or guitar and has no respect for us!"
4151,Horrible teacher. She takes forever to grade assignments and you won't learn anything. She is mean and unfair to random students. Her grading system isn't fair at all. Stay away from her.
4204,"I always got really good grades in her Spanish classes (95 and above) but she never even acknowledged me and let students who weren't as good as me be on the Spanish honor society, she favors people"
4257,"Perhaps it's the whole idea of grading the fine arts that doesn't sit well with me, but Stecker comes off as phony and arbitrary, a combination most students end up disliking."
4310,One of those people who always has to be right. Ive never seen anyone teacher pick favorites as much as her. If you ever try to contradict her or get in any kind of debate you will not get a good grade in her class.
4364,Well..... All he does is talk... Hes harsh on us sometimes and sometimes unfair... He needs to teach us about P.E not about `blah blah blah' like he usually does. But i <3 him! Dont hate-appreciate!!!
4417,"i was in band for 2 years. He is a good player, but because you can play doesn't mean you can teach, very mean, couldn't teach and he's one fo those people who is always right, even if you have proof"

4630,Ms. Williams 1/2 your students can't pass your tests!!! Shouldn't that tell you something!!! It's quite obvious!
4683,"Ms. moser is the worst teacher I have ever had. She literally will hand out CBRs for any reason, Forgetting pencil, slouching, and crouching behind stand. She even went as far to tell us she was getting ""bullied"" by STUDENTS because the students were playing Careless Whisper, a song she hates. Also she skips the announcements all the time and she easily plays favorites. She is the reason why I will not be doing marching band in lynbrook and I would like to enjoy my last year at miller. :("
4736,Mrs.Sanchez wasn't all that nice. One reason I thought that is because she treated us like we we were in 2nd grade when we were very mature and she was one of those teachers who picks favorites (girls
4789,"Hard to understand what she is saying. Had to learn from the book. Being friends with her will give you a ""better"" grade. Dislike tardiness, and class clowns."
4843,"Each year she picks her smartest student to pick on, and she is relentless. She also is clueless. For example, she told me William B. Yeats was Australian, and that MELANCHOLIC is not a word. She often complains about her problems, and favors the girls on the basketball team. Without a doubt the most uneducated and immoral teacher that I have ever had. She is not qualified to be an English teacher."
4896,"The vendetta which he has started stems from me choosing science over history. Rather than understand, he chooses to degrate me, talking behind my back. Thanks."
4949,Picks favorites and is not objective about a student if he doesn't like them. can be discouraging if he doesn't like you which sucks for middle school. He's great to geeks and underdogs and has no sympathy for kids who are seeking to be popular or confused about values even if they are talented in digital design. Very disappointing and can influence choices badly.
5002,"I mean, he knows a lot about music, but in everything else, he's pretty much a sitting rock. He gets really upset about the tiniest mistakes, plays favorites A LOT with the actually skilled kids in the class, and pretty much hates everyone else. The only reason he still has his job is because, A. Nobody else is there to take it, and B. He's smart-ish in the one department he does teach.Still, though, one of the worst teachers I've ever had."
5055,"She picks favorites like its her job. She gets involved in students personal lives in attempts to stop drama but then makes it worse by only protecting her ""favorites"". In general She is a bad person."
5109,least considerate teacher ever. He picks on the same kids consistently and does not understand that his class is mandatory. He expects that everyone wants to be in his class as opposed to forced into
5162,"Sure her class is easy....if you do history fair and get a good grade on first essay. Plays favorites, seems to not know what she talks about, DOESN'T TEACH!!!!"
5215,"Subjective grading, lack of clarity on expectations. Just an awful teacher that you have to suffer through before you get to the good ones."
5268,easy to fool if ur female u can say anything hard to understand her speech will give in to anthing so complain abt teachers if u don like grade make stuff up she beleives it not so gud w boys but girlz own her
