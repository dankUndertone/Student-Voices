1559,Always puts people on the spot like what there is so much homework there is no time for anything else just stop the random calling
1617,"Mrs. Faszewski is a bad teacher. All she did was put me down. I was an athlete and I always tried hard in her class, yet she never respected me. She'll only like you if your are physically challenged."
1675,Way to many presentations in his class. Liked to make dumb jokes while making of his own students. Always looks very tired...LAZY

1848,"Worst teacher ever. Hates students. Has ridiculously high expectations of sophomore work, yet treats 15-year-olds like 5 year olds... also flips out if you're wearing scented lotion."
1906,"the only reason people like her is that she'll let you talk in class all day and you don't have to do any work. and she'll let you skip from another class into her class.
not a very teacher-like attitude.
always late to fourth period class.
i'll admit she is usually nice. but SO LAZY."
1963,"She treats the class like 5-year-olds, and is surprised when they act like it. She seems like a nice person, but not an excellent teacher. Unclear explanations--i'm always confused"

2368,she is okay but she favors kids and i dont really like the way she teaches. Also she never lets anyone go to the restroom ! that makes me mad ! she is not my favorite teacher !!!
2425,she talks to us like we're idiots and really doesn't feel like explaining things for somebody who is having trouble understanding. there are so many times i want to get up there and explain CLEARLY

2541,she likes to scream alot when nobody is doing anything at all!!!! if she doesnt hate you your going to get a 100.
2599,"i find her to be a bit annoying. last time i checked, making friends with the mischievous kids and mistreating those who actually behave is a bit out of place"

3061,shes so phony. She all smiley and talks to you sometimes and than ignores you when she is in a bad mood
3119,he is a teacher he feels like he has to prove something by arguing and giving detentions. He is the type of teacher he worrys more about how kids respect him and act then what they actually learn
3176,Ms. Delvecchio is one of the worst teachers i have ever had. She doesnt explain things well enough and treats us like we are 5 years old!! And i dont like her
3234,"Terrible. So full of herself, even though she has the worst skin condition I have ever seen. She just likes to control everything and everyone, and is so fake"
3292,"This teacher needs to take a course in discipline. He needs to realize you can't be ""friends"" with the students. He is afraid of the 'bad' kids and lets them get away with everything!!"
3350,"If the class if called drawing, then why are we doing photography and painting and building props...? Plus teacher is very moody. Did not enjoy one bit."
3407,"Some kids like him, but i don't. Yeah its amusing when he goes on tangents, but then we never learn what we are supposed to learn. He's like ""oh yeah test tomorrow"" and we're like ""on WHAT?"" Hard cuz"
3465,i don't really like you that muchyou always got me in trouble because i crawled under the tables but i liked when u let us make prank phone calls on the lax bus
3523,im surprised she still has kids in the class..no one likes her...no one likes the class...she doesnt make it fun at all..she yells alot...horrible
3581,"She always looks over my shoulder to see if I'm paying attention. It gets really annoying, because it makes me uncomfortable. If I know the subject, then I'm drawing! So what if I don't pay attention, I don't like math! In general! But her as a person, she's pretty nice."
3638,the only reason we dont like her is beacuse she is mean to everyone for no reason... kids are just sticking up for themselves and it makes us look like we're bad.
3696,He has no idea what life is like for students these days and all he does is take away all the rights we have and make high school even more miserable. He is uptight and not open to any sort of fun.
3754,Ms. Lindvall really knows her speech. What she lacks is the ability to relate to students. It is almost like she enjoys seeing kids fail.
3812,"I dont know what u think, but I think that he doesnt treat kids good enough. U are too rought. If a kid is late for 5 seconds, u mark him late and unprepeared"
3869,She is always very stressed out and s\has favorites. If you aren't an A student she'll give you a bad grade.
3927,"She is like the grinch, you cannot smile with out getting written up, and nobody really cares that much. She thinks it is harder than it is."
3985,He's really mean. He likes to talk a lot and we didn't do very much in his class. I wish I had had Kraft.
4043,"She seems like she doesnt know what she is teaching. She is funny and likes to make jokes with the class, but is incapable of helping a student and sometimes makes students feel clueless"
4100,"Hated this class. It wasn't hard, but Mrs. she herself ruined it. It's not that she's strict/mean- she's that, she's fake, and she makes you feel horrid about yourself and afraid to ask questions."
4158,"She doesn' even use a textbook which makes it hard to keep up. I hate her class and she doesn't care about any of her students. Not to mention our UCP class is above the Honors, and she is way top tryhard. Don't reccomend her, I feel you if you get her :("
4216,always make mistakes and obviously has favorites She has crazy mood swings and always yells at everyone
4274,"One of the worst teachers I ever had, didn't like me from the first day, and she really doesn't think students should play sports and school at the same time. HORIBBLE!!!!!!!!!!!"
4332,she is very hard to understand and can not control a class...not to mention all she does is move ur seat

4447,OMG she acts like we are baby's one time she was a sub religion and she said because im the teacher and ur not so nah nah nah nah (i forget what for thopguh) in a baby voice
4505,She treats all of her students differntly if she likes you than you are find but if you are a boy than no chance
4563,"She is not afraid to take control of the situation. Which is a bad thing. She makes it seem that she is in charge, even with the other teachers which are at same level in the heirarchy of school."
4620,"SWITZER is always acting like everything is fine and he has everything in control when it isn't, he has no good advice and does not own up to his word. I hear complaints from my son everyday about him and im tired of it. Ardrey kell is a wonderfull school but either switzers leaving or we are"
4678,I just really hated doing current events. It was so much pressure and I hated having to get up in front of the whole class and speak about things that i never felt interested in. :(
4736,Mrs.coughey is a very unfair teacher that makes it clear which students she likes better. this makes me question her decision makeing
4794,I have Mr. Andress right now and he seems like a nice person but his jokes are really corny and there always geared towards someone. so if your sensitive be careful/ also he's a horrible math teacher
4851,Maybe Rusilas should have been a scientist instead of a teacher. She really doesn't seem to like people or kids or teaching or helping...she does know her stuff but she can't seem to explain it and seems annoyed that she has to.
4909,All she does is call on people who she likes a just lets people who dont understand get farther and farther behind. HORRIBLE TEACHER

5256,"The moment you walk in his class, you can feel the aura of stupidity just overwhelming your body. I can teach better than him and prepare materials. Make sure you have your friends around you to deal with him."
5313,SHE THE WORST TEACHER TELLS TO MUCH PERSON BUSINESS SHE IS A CRY BABY SHE NEEDS TO DEAL WITH IT EVERYONE HAS PROBLEMS!!!
5371,I didn't like her class at all. She was really confusing and I felt like I couldn't come to her with questions. Everyone says she's only cool if you chill with her outside of class.
5429,i remember her being soooo mean to all the kids and she favored all the smart kids...she made my 7th grade year really bad for me and alot of other people
5487,"She acts immature, plays favorites, talks too much about her daughters, and is not prepared. I always get the feeling she doesn't really know her material."

5602,"Okay, you SOOOOOO do not help the people that need it and the people who don't. I don't like your methods and you try to be our buddies instead of our teacher!"
5660,"In class she refuses to teach us whenever we misbehave. She teaches us very little. I recommend her to be a teacher for young elementary school teachers, or not one at all."

5891,"Unless you like people that say one thing and do another, and treat people with no consistency, he is a horrible headmaster."

6122,I cant stand this class....you always get mad at little things....i hate coming to this class on b days
6238,I did not get along with him and didn't feel he was a very good teacher. I'm not so sure that it was him or me. He argues with kids who do not think the same thing that he does. He continuously underm
6353,Personally I think that if Mrs. Carbonell feels she needs to favor an orgainization it should be one that matters in life like HOSA! Not worthless ellite!
6469,"OK everybody is entitled to their opinions and Mrs. Bramlett is not the best teacher and can come across rude sometimes, and this is what most of students dont like. She is rushed and not clear at all. In my opinion if you have aquestion ask other students because mrs.bramlett becomes very stressed and you wind up more confused!!! And to all of you in bramlett group when we dont cry we arent babies we get even. She treats us like babies not even kids. Only certain people can deal with her."
6584,I luv him he makes me feel warm inside. When he taught us enlargements and reductions my friend and I felt a strong connection to him.
6700,"Bad, bad, bad. Im a 7 and he's my first gym teacher and I hate him. he makes us run around all the time and ugh..."

6931,Mazur you are soooo mean. You are the ADULT. You are the TEACHER but you act like a 12 year old. MAZUR GROW UP AND STOP RUINING LIVES. STOP PICKING ON KIDS.
7046,"She barely taught my class, always seemed to have a bad attitude, and openly picked favorites. Not trying to sound harsh but she is the worst teacher I've had so far"
7162,"she's so elitist and obnoxious. She's a high school teacher, but she acts like all non-music students are below her"
7277,"he tries so hard to be cool, it's kind of amusing; he makes Mr. Dhallan look like a great Physics teacher unfortunately"
7393,"This guy is a liar. He gives everyone he likes an A , even if they do nothing in his class. Anyone he doesn't like, he'll give them a D, even if they do all their work and do a good job at what they do and behave in class and"
7508,She is so disorganized! i have her this yr (7th grade) and all her projects r rediculious and have nothing 2 do with the work. gullable 2...she looks like the cat in the hat! i dont like her at all!!!

7970,Her class was okay but I didnt feel like she was invested in the material. Maybe music isnt her thing.
8086,"She is the worst teacher I've ever had. She has no control of a class whatsoever - everybody calls out and she takes a long time to call on people that actually raise their hands. On top of that, she doesn't know what she's teaching and reads notes from another teacher."
8201,"i don't like at all. very mean lady, and needs to start being nicer to students, and stop acting like you're so nice around adults. just be nice!!!"
8317,"Very boring, VERY opinionated teacher. It doesn't matter if you're just voicing your opinion, if she doesn't agree with it, it's wrong. Also, like someone already mentioned, she treats her students like 4th graders. C'mon, reading journals for seniors?"
8432,rude and not helpful. she calls people out on their bad grades when its not her place. Makes you afraid of math.
8548,"This is the best teacher ever... if you love textbooks. I kind of feel bad for him because most kids don't like him, but if he wants to be likrd, he should consider teaching or coming up with a real lesson plan. However, it is easy to work ahead on stuff."
8664,to strict and has really dumb rules aside from that i dont learn anything in her class.. she has a very bad way of teaching that is bad and is not a good way to teach students..i wish i could switch o
8779,"A ""Perfectionist"" as she calls herself. Her notes are unclear, unorganized, and at times hard to read. She does indeed pick favorites, not always the smarter kids. If you do come in for extra help she"
8895,I hated her class with a passion. And I like math! I feel bad because I know she really really tries but...sometimes your best isn't good enough.
9010,"Super mean, doesn't really care about your education if she doesn't like you"
9126,she fails at a teacher. i am one of her favorites yet i c her pik on all the other kids in her class. seriously get out while u caaan!!
9241,"I really don't understand why everyone likes him. He's so arrogant and rude. It's incredible, and he's not even a good teacher. Someone should do something about him. It's the worst when he picks favorites, and he does that often."
9357,"She's very ignorant. People used to make fun of me through out the day and she doesn't say a word. Also, I was crying and she didn't notice."
9472,Ms. Peebles is ok. It would be a lot better if she took less time trying to act like the mighty ruler of classroom and more time actually explaining the lesson.
9588,she is the meanest teacher who is always nice to you when the parents are there and she always makes you loose recess if u dont turn in your homework or don't sighn your name.
9703,"Grandma blaustein is a teacher who picks favorites. She only likes the certain kids perferbly the ""in crowd kids"" and she is annoying. Her voice is so annoying! and she needs to be quiet sometimes and"
9819,She is terrible.....idk what we are even doing in her class right now....seems like were playing with rock and not learning about anything in class :(
9934,She is the worst teacher ever and majority of the people don't like her at all. Do not take her class if you like chemistry b/c she will make you hate the subject. She doesn't even trust her students.
10050,"Terrible teacher who doesn't teach anything in class. Has no ability in controlling a class, and thinks ""being nice"" works 24/7."
10165,He needs to stop teaching. HW is unclear and his grading has been questioned more than once. He feels the entire class should be punished for one kids mistakes
10281,i DONT like him!! he has his favs! and the ones that are his favs NEVER get in trouble! when they are constantly interupting!! i HATE HIM!! sry mr.downes! man he really is down!!
10396,This is her first year teaching AP government and while she is personable and guinuinally cares bout her students; her idea of AP is terribly misconstrued. She assigns homework and assignments to the point where all students feel like they're drowning. We feel like we can't cach up and we're all failing. Awful class with mediocre teacher.
10512,"She's a teacher who gives you freedom and treats you like an adult. A nice person to be friends with, but she randomly leaves our class several times in a class period and when she does teach us, it's always about something philosophical. To be honest, i learned nothing in her class."
10627,"I have several problems with Mr. Giles. I love psychology, but it's hard to go to his class b/c of the way he acts. He strikes me as one of those people who wanted to be a therapist or a politician, not a teacher."
10743,"Although she is nice, don't be fooled. She is terrible a terrible teacher. Doesn't explain things well. Her voice is annoying and talks way too much. Also, she treats a 10th grade class like we are 5 year olds. Her class is easy though you will hate this class. I don't usually hate a lot of classes, but whenever I walk in to her class it gives me negative vibes. You will do well but Mrs. Pasacrita has given me an experience this year that I don't want to deal with again. Good luck!?"
10858,"She always laughs at you if you ask a question about something that ""you should already know"" and its not the nice kind of laugh where you know she's being funny.. its mean. She makes you feel dumb.Plus, she's very boring.bad"
10974,You like giving silent lunch for minor things and have to have everything your certain way. Not cool!!!!!!!!!
11089,"She acts very perky to the point that it's unnatural, yet underneath all of that she is extremely salty and passive aggressive. I follow all of her little guidelines but she still deducts points off my projects because she dislikes me since I am more shy and reserved. When I ask her about it she always says ""It was super good but just not outstanding."" We waste so much time in that class telling our partner how we feel and doing ""class meetings"" where we sit in a circle and talk about feelings."
11205,she was an awfull teacher. Very dumb projects that are not usefull at all and she is very mean. Avoid your kid having her.
11320,She is the worst teacher ever!!!! she does not understand that everyone is not good at art and gives u bad grades! I feel bad if u get her!!
11436,"this class was terrible. Everyone loves her and thinks she is the coolest, nicest teacher but she favorited kids, didn't help us in class, gave us limited time on things, and assigned us ridiculous activities. And she also didn't like some kids opposed to favoriting some. Terrible class, dreaded going in there every day."
