71,When I was in highschool this teacher mocked a straight-A student in a humiliating and innappropriate manner.
143,Very poor attitude with students. Becomes angry easily and singles out students for mistakes. Loves to condescend. Several parents have had meetings with this person and no changes.
215,She mistakes rigor in her judgment of students with quality in her instructional approach. I think she would be happy not to have to work and the resentment shows.
287,"Terrible teacher, does not care about students, would take off points for no apparent reason. Makes assumptions and has very linear mentality."
359,Offer more eye contact; Don't be so stiff; Be more flexible; And be available to students if they need extra help;
431,I have tried to contact this teacher 3 different times and there has been no response. She refuses to communicate and I am a very unhappy parent.
503,No respect for the kids he teaches. If he was to have passion for what he does and treated his students with respect he would get the respect he so dearly desires
575,This teacher is a u know what! She doesnt care about her students and she is a very rude person! She never helps her students & makes them have low selfesteem!
647,"horrible teacher, prefers native speakers over others and commonly accuses non-native speakers of cheating because she doesn't believe in their capability."
719,Ms. Stubbs is a insufficent teacher and is not capable of creating a safe and caring environment for the students she teaches. Please do not get the idea I don't respect her because the state of her
791,takes an immature approach to teaching. suggests that respect between a student and teacher MUST me mutual or else she won't be respectful (role model??)
863,"As a parent I feel that Ms. Alemany should choose another profession. She is inadequate as a teacher, who does not care about her students."
935,I will not allow my child to ever be to placed under the authority of this teacher again! The experience was less than pleasant.
1007,This is the only teacher my child has ever had an issue with in 11 years of schooling. She has zero compassion for students and their personal circumstances. She is unwilling to adjust her approach to a way that child might learn more effectively. My child and I have both reached out to her to try and get my child the extra help to succeed and she refused. This teacher marks assignments as zeros for my child when they are complete & correct because she assumes they aren't before checking.
1079,"This teacher isn't very explanitory, and he isn't my favorite, and he has a little temper, but I can deal with him."
1151,Janet Payne has no tolerance for less than perfect children. She uses harsh words shouted in their ears and belittles infront of the other children. Unless your child is stellar in the classroom bewar
1223,completely unprofessional and talks down to students. I have witnessed her insulting students for not understanding concepts and degrading them. cannot wait to transfer out of her class!
1295,"Very unhelpful, makes students do everything on their own with little support, believes they should do everything themselves."
1367,"very rude, ignorant to students and parents , even those of good students,she has destroyed the intangible spirit at GHS, which is terrible as she was a GHS graduate."
1439,Fred is a knowledgeable teacher but is not helpful or clear in his instructions and meetings.
1511,"Mr. Kattula is unkind and unresourceful. He often misunderstands students. For example, if a child asks his peers for the date, he thinks that the student is distracting the class!"
1583,I am very unhappy with the lack of professionalism here by the faculty nd the things they say. (Especially this one)
1655,"I feel that Joan is very two-faced. She is for the teachers when teachers come to her, but at the same time she's for the parents just as much. I think that St. Agatha would benefit more without her"
1727,"My child comes home every day, in tears, bawling on my shoulder. Carol Ward is an awful teacher, with no respect for her students. The homework they are required to complete each night, in such little time, with no explanation of how to do so, is unbelievably unacceptable. This problem should be resolved VERY soon."
1799,I think mrs. Bollinger has a contract with ICC to send as many students as possible. She isn't very helpful and doesn't really do her job as counselor
1871,"Mrs Yetto has turned more students off to music than she will ever inspire. She uses bullying and fear tactics as instuments of ""education"". She does not provide substantive instruction or materials."
1943,she never treats any teacher with respect. She barges into the class room demands that we listen to her.
2015,Certainly one of the best teachers Westlake has to offer. If you want your child to have a great kindergarten experience I recommend him!
2086,A horrible role model. His 'firey' attitude is just a way of saying he is angry. Makes horribly prejudice remarks and is a throwback to a different era.
2158,She cares to much about sports and does not recognize excelling students but rather those who bring home sports trophies.
2230,Argumentative and sarcastic with students in class. She damaged my son's self esteem and confidence in language skills. He was formerly an A student in all of his spanish classes.
2302,she doesn't respect students so she doesn't get respect back also she doesn't care about teaching anyone
2374,He calls students out if they are not doing well. Isn't very helpful. Gives out way too much homework
2446,He was condescending to the students. At one point verbally abusive to a student to the point the student withdrew from the class. At the end of the semester most of the students had withdrawn. The principal defended him even though there was evidence of the verbal abuse (statements from other students). I would recommend him for no teaching job.
2518,"She will lie to make herself look good in any situation. She does not care about others, only herself."
2590,you need to be more considerate of your students treat us with some respect then maybe students will like you!
2662,This teacher is very rude to her students. I regret having this class and doesn't care when she loses her student's work.
2734,"I'm a Parent of an Honor student.. my son didn't tell me until the the end of the year that Mr. Arroyo's teachings were slightly unethical.. his constant taunts and sarcasm towards his students were very insulting and undermining.. at first I said to my son,maybe it's you being too sensitive, but after speaking to several other parents they agreed and were so dissatisfied with the way he taught. He would tease, taunt and sometimes make fun of his students. he's only nice to his baseball team.."
2806,"She has too much emotional baggage with her. Her boyfriend is married and she talks about him all the time. It's really quite sad. I enjoy teachers who serve as role models and help guide me. Obviously, I'll refrain from seeking her mentorship."
2878,"Verbal and written communications sent home to parents are extremely condescending. Never had a problem with my kid enjoying school until her. I've never met a teacher so rude and talks down to parents if things are not done her way. Everyday my kid comes home I hear stories of how Garcia has yelled at them and made the entire class run for ""talking"". The environment for children especially small children should be warm and welcoming not hostile. In a nutshell no I would not recommend her."
2950,She is not cooperative with students. She is rigid and does give time to students. I got very bad impression of her.
3022,"she is friendly to popular kids, and helps them more than she should, while ignoring her own students."
3094,A bitter vindictive woman who should have EVER gone into teaching if she had any respect for the quality of education at AHS.
3166,She is not meant to be a principal. She does not know how to deal with certain situations at all. When students try to express themselves to her she does not try to hear it. Instead she makes assumptions and does not give the right information. I believe she is not eligible to be dealing with students our age.
3238,"Mr.Rollins is a very uncaring person who does not keep his political views to himself, which causes him to be a very unlikeable teacher"
3310,"Very rude, does not like kids, especially her students(unless they are a cheerleader), never available for a conference with a parent or a student when she says she will be. NO HELP what-so-ever when students ask for it, as a parent if you try to ask all you get is an attitude. Good luck to anyone who gets her as a teacher, I am truly sorry for you and your child."
3382,Very Unfair teacher to his students and does not care about how his students feel
3454,Not helpful. She is too caught up into her social life. Doesn't care about her students. Learn how to teach and show compasssion toward us.
3526,"As a parent, I'm frustrated that my daughter is not enjoying her French because of ms Coldiron. I spoke to other parents and they have the same problem. Are there any changes that am be made which can enhance my students learning for the better?"
3598,"unkind, disrespectful, unhelpful, boring, upsetting, makes other stressful, ALWAYS has to stay on time and can NEVER be flexible"
3670,Madame Willis is nosy and unnecessarily personal with her students. She is very unprofessional and snobby.
3742,"Dr. Joe Gilhaus works for the district office now. He has made a new transfer policy in which is unfair to students in the Shawnee mission district. This man doesn't have any respect for children, and he certainly does not have what it takes to be a teacher."
3814,"My child's experience with Ms. Peterson was very bad to say the least. Ms. Peterson is known for poor attendance, extreme favoritism, and unfair treatment. She's rarely in class, usually missing 2 and sometimes even 3 days a week. She has a group of students she regards as her favorites, and these students are often treated much more leniently and have more privileges than their fellow classmates. My child, and those of other parents, have encountered many problems because of these issues."
3886,Unimpressive as an educator. More worried about himself and his outside interests. He does not care about students and is just going through the motions. School district does not care -- too many bad teachers like this.
3958,Lauren Otero is now an admin at A P Leto High School. If she truly wants to advance in her career she should not make snap judgements. Getting to know the students and the areas in which you have been
4030,My child was never happy in her class and complained of many instances where she treats the kids unfairly. She has no compassion for the kids in class and is plain rude to them most of the times.
4102,Worst teacher I've ever had. She puts students down and never offers constructive criticism.
4173,"it is very obvious that dr. birch favors certain students over others, and if you are unfortunate enough to be one of those she does not favor, she could not care less about you."
4245,"She expects far too much from her students, and criticizes her students if they do something wrong; causing students to constantly feel vulnerable and unstable. Although she provides resources, she lacks knowledge of actually teaching her students something. Depending on her mood, she may ignore a student in need of help, and target them in class."
4317,Terrible principal! Doesn't help the students when they need it. The vice principal does more work then her!
4389,i don't like her... she doesn't teach properly and call parents for no apparent reason. my mother and other mothers have had to talk to her and the principal about her behavior
4461,"As a parent, we dis-liked Ms Palumbo, at her previous school Desert Vista, she was considered rude and unhelpful. As parents we met with Deot head/Asst Princpal to complain and eventually they listened and she was fired in May 2012. She is rude to parents, dismissive and intolerant, to pupils she was mean and divisive. She seems to live through NatLatin League and uses it to forward herself at the expense of students, Oh Seton Catholic, you don't know what you have done hiring her!"
4533,She never seemed to care about me or any other student. It was all about doing her job and in the end she never was much help.
4605,I would hardly call him a teacher. He listens to the same music every day during class and tells his students that they are not allowed to ask him for help. Disgrace to his profession.
4677,Very unprofessional. Degrades and embarasses students in class. Knows what she is talking about in math but very narrow minded and unhappy and unwilling to help. i can think of one word to describe he
4749,"Mrs. Back is one of the few teachers that I have absolutely no respect for. She has no respect for her students, and deserves none in return."
4821,she's the laziest teacher ever. she recycles her lessons over and over again. she will not detour from them regardless of her students struggling or not. I would suggest taking Spanish instead.
4893,She didn't acknowledge that some students may need extra help or extra clarification- I came in as a straight A's student and walked out with a C.. good luck.
4965,"Unhelpful, unclear, and doesn't treat people with respect. Self-centered, and egotistical! Not very knowledgeable either!"
5037,Horrible. Experience. Did not grade properly. Blames fault on students and doesn't take blame for his own mistakes. Bad guy
5109,His character is not one that I want to have my child around. He has proven himself to be manipulative and untrustworthy. I do not recommend that anyone allow him to teach their child.
5181,"She is rather rude to certain parents whose children are core(zone) students, and very nice to parents whose children are magnet students.She's helpful if you are not hispanic or black,not a good person to be in her position, you have to treat all children the same fairness goes a long way,people tend to notice the difference quickly.Magnet parents are treated like GOLD and Core (ZONE KIDS) need I have to spell it out , it is without a doubt different in treatment at this school."
5253,The admissions packet sent to perspective students states that the students think highly of their teachers.(Ameisen) That publication does not relect what we students think of her.
5325,"mr bushee is one of the rudest, most cruel teachers i have ever had! he derives fun from making fun of his students! its also nearly impossible to get an 'A' in his class. dont take him, take Mr Lee!"
5397,DOES NOT TEACH. Assigns independent units to avoid doing any work herself. She constantly criticizes students and does not offer any real help. WORST teacher I have ever had.
5469,"if the average score on a test is an F and the high score is a C, isn't that a sign it's the teacher's fault and not the students'?"
5541,"Very rude, disrespectful, abusive, doesn't listen or help. Doesn't care if you understand, even though he says he does"
5613,"Tends to think students are wrong at everything, is extremely critical of student's writing, and tends to pick favorites. Nice guy, but he needs some work."
5685,She has the potential to be a really good teacher but at least in my experience she was rude and unhelpful when anyone tried to ask questions.
5757,"Cindy Riordan clearly mixes politics with her take on the education system. She teaches and grades her students from a bias perspective based on the parents' politcal affiliations and views, that are generally reflected in their children. She will punish a student and more harshly grade their work if she senses a parent is not on her side of the political spectrum."
5829,"Mr. Allen was too easy on students. Students that should've gotten D's, got C's or B's. HE was not patient at all."
5901,shes so mean. and why do we have to pull up our shirts if our shoulders are possiblee showing. oh get over it
5973,"Diane is not the world's best math teacher, to put things lightly. Sixth grade parents, please do not pick her for your child's TA. They will have to have her for math, but avoid her if possible."
6045,This is the one teacher at the whole school that I truely hate. She has completely forgotten that her job is to help the students. Makes me sick.
6117,"Does not encourage academic achievement. Little to show for all of the monetary support by parents, athletic teams, AP exams, clubs, MCPS, etc."
6188,seems to be totally lost as a science teacher and makes it impossible for students or parents to get any information that might help the student achieve at a higher level. Refuses to use a science boo
6260,"Ruth Garcia in all fairness as a principle, does a decent job. However as a person she is extremely rude to her staff, students, and parents. She does not understand students and is ineffective in resolving student related conflicts. I attempted to attend a parent LSC meeting once only to find out her and the vice principle basically control everything, the actual members don't do anything except sign their name for a position that they don't control. So sad to see what this school has become."
6332,he is my science teacher and he is honestly too strict and very rude.. my parents want to transfer me out of his class because of how bad he is teaching me and his students.. i dislike him very much and if you have him well good luck.
6404,"I've found Ms. Anders to be one of the worst teachers my child has had the misfortune of having. She is unkind, mean spirited in the extreme and constantly belittles her students. Most students end up dropping her class which says a lot about a teacher. I would steer clear. As far as homework....she really piles it on. That wouldn't be so bad if she actually taught the concepts but she does not. That makes for some pretty frustrated kids....and their parents."
6476,She assigns way to much home work and does not realize that eventually students get bored and do not even read the chapters. She does not understand all the work high school students have.
6548,My experience with Mr. Parker is less than desirable. He does not keep canvas updated and he seems to be more interested in the basketball team he coaches. He is not helpful and does not respond to questions in a timely manner.
6620,Only cares for her favorite students. She doesn't even acknowledge you if she knows you and sees you in the halls. She is very cold to most students.
6692,"Not only I'm grading her poorly and trying to bring down others opinion. I struggled in that class, by no means, she refused to help me. When I said i wanted to endter math analysis because I had an A she said she wouldn't recommend that class because of my struggle and that I would fail that class. I have an A in math analysis. She's very rude and unkind to me as a student and she refuses to help. Don't make her hate you."
6764,very unhelpful and brings nothing but dry lectures & labs to the classroom. she always seems to have a mean tone of voice and expression as well.
6836,I have never met such a pompous man. He sees everything in terms of himself and not his students. He may be accessible but never helpful. I have absolutely no respect for him at all.
6908,"granted i had her...six years ago, but I disliked her more than I had ever disliked any teacher. Forget her as a person, she's there to teach, and she's not good at it. Why she still works at Chantilly (or works period) is beyond me. She was not helpful."
6980,"shes insulted everyone in the class so far. she calls us stupid, disrespects us, and disregards our feelings. how'd she get the teacher of the year award? ugh."
7052,"Does not care about his students. Favors some over others. Not a helpful teacher, and his two-question quizzes are hard. Not a devoted teacher. Overall, Mr. Odon should not be teaching at Maimonides."
7124,The extra help needed to succeed in a class like AP Chem was just non-existent. The subjective manner in which grading and classroom participation is conducted was disheartening.
7196,The seminars in history are waste of time because he is always off topics and confusing. He socialized with certain students which creates unwelcome environment to others who want to learn.
7196,The seminars in history are waste of time because he is always off topics and confusing. He socialized with certain students which creates unwelcome environment to others who want to learn.
7340,"When he talks to parents, he's fine. But kids, he acts completely different. Very unreasonable and not understanding of how children feel."
7484,"Arrogant, unrealistic, and insensitive to his environment. Good fundamental teacher in lecturing, but everything else needs work."
7628,He's an aweful teacher and didn't try and reach out to my child. Seemed to be very geared toward favortism; wrong way to teach.
7772,"I wasn't even her student, but I''m in Interact and I've had exactly one encounter with her... when I got my NHS app signed. From my experience, I have gathered that she is the complete antithesis of a teacher I would want. Right when you walk into a room she's in, there's just this aura of gloom. When in conversation, she makes me want to crawl up in a ball. I kinda want to punch her in the face :)"
7916,She leaves us in the beginning of the year. Yes to adapt a baby but when she comes back she makes no attempt to connect with any students to see what needs they have. She immediately changes the class to how she wanted it not carring how other students take it. Then She doesn't tell students about assignments because she expects us to prioritize her class over our other classes. Then when a student turned in said project she failed to tell the class about she takes off 50%.
8060,"He constantly plays favorites. Very rude and arrogant. You don't have to take Euro you can take pyschology instead and should, otherwise your gpa will suffer. He is very skeptical about everything"
8204,I wish the administration was aware how discouraged the 6th graders are by this teacher. So many want to quit band but can't. He has a bad temper too.
8347,"seems to nice, not very good at helping individual students when needed, but easy class if you can do math."
8491,"Out of every 3 assignments completed and turned in, only 1 will be counted as she blames YOU for loosing it. Indy staff NEEDS to listen and look over these concerns from student and parents. Seriously"
8635,I am a student who loves English and got along with all of my teachers. I dreaded going to her class. She degraded students on a daily basis and was the worst teacher I ever had.
8779,"Dishonest in grading. Doesn't care that I needed help. He lost some papers and some grades. My Mom had to go to the principle, and he was still hardly helpful. So glad that I never have to have him for a teacher again!"
8923,She chooses to show disrespect toward students just because she feels she has the power to. What a weak-willed sadist.
9067,"He yells to much. He should come down alittle bit. It helps students to feel comfortable around him, if he don't yell."
9211,This world history teacher shows discrimination through her action and words to students. She doesn't think of diversity and cultural difference. She is not fair to students in many ways.
9355,This teacher has no respect for her students. most of the students are smarter than she is. She is always being corrected and needs to retire
9499,"This teacher seemed good from the start. As the year continued she became more and more impatient with her students. She was rude and was not helpful to the students who had a hard time. She usually just gave work from the textbooks and called it a day. Aside from this, she made learning spanish a dreadful time. Poor teacher, would not recommend."
9643,"Total irresponsible, disrespectful man. Always made fun of other students and never showed any respect. Never took anything serious. Same goes for that female principal who is even worse!"
9787,"She's a very oblivious teacher. She never set boundaries for our class which made us students out of control. She treats us like her children, not like her students. She's overal not fit to be a middle school teacher or even a teacher in general. Mrs.McCargar cannot explain anything and also can't answer questions that the class/individuals ask. She tells us to wait for clarification even though it's a question she should know. I would recommend switching out if you're a student."
9931,Burnie Stripling is the worst teacher that I have ever had he dose not care about his students and is arrogant and rude. He made my freshman year miserable. He only likes you if you are smart and if you have an opinion about anything he gets angry. Do not recommend him at all1
10075,Personally I think mr.boyd is a terrible teacher while yes he does attempt to make jokes he quickly shuts down any fun going on in the classroom even if he started it. He makes students feel uncomfortable when theyou ask for extra help and is more Lenient twards girls in the class and actually in a way shows off to them he makes me uncomfortable I seriously think he should be put on a watch list I would put 0 stars but I can't so I put 1/5
10219,"I never liked you. You always gave too much work and not enough time to complete it, condescending to your students, were too personal about your life problems, and just not professional."
10362,She is an awful teacher and coach! She has no idea what she's doing and will constantly put people down in extremely harsh ways. I have no idea why she is still at this school.
10506,"She has totally broken my child emotionally. I will have to say she has no kind manner, and I totally disapprove of her style."
10650,"I will never forget the terrifying experience I had with Ms. Pham. She was disrespectful, unfair, and shouted at me because she accidentally lost my work. Also she did not care about her students she is like a robot.. you don't know her until her true colors are unmasked."
10794,"Worst teacher I've ever had. Extremely rude and bitter. She tries to live vicariously through her student, so she constantly plays favorites. Not helpful whatsoever. When ou raise her hand to ask a question, she will blatantly ignore you. Gives a crucial amount of homework, with hardly any class times. As a person who does theatre and has a part time job after school, I don't always have time to finish homework, but she is not understanding whatsoever. She will fail you for personal reasons."
10938,"Terrible teacher. Students were either in his ""posse"" (on his good side), were loathed and harrassed every day (like myself), or passed through 4 years completely unrecognized (the majority)."
11082,"extremely unhelpful when asked a ? and always turns you away in her stubbornness, continuing to type aimlessly on her computer-goes from laughter to anger in the blink of an eye"
11226,"He is an incrediblely lazy teacher, especially during 4th quater. He never grades any test/quizzes, but makes students grade them themselves. On papers, he only very briefly reads the front page. If y"
11370,"Doesn't practice what she teaches. Holds students to high standards in language arts, but repeatedly sends homework assignments with embarrassing mistakes--typos, awkward sentences, and lack of crispness. Proofread please. Stop sending students and parents such sloppy work week after week."
11514,"Level of Professionalism: He will go out of his way to lower your grade if he doesn't like you, so watch out. Try to get another teacher, like Coach Yanke or Kramer."
11658,"Like the Defense Against Dark Arts,we seem to go through orchestra teachers. This one is cruel with a cold wit."
11802,"Madame seems to hate children, if you fall behind or don't understand something you're simply the weakest link and left behind to fight off the wolves all alone"
11946,"I was in Mr Hanavan's Freshmen Art History class. Havanan has no ability to control a class and a very short temper. He never full answers your questions regarding assignments, which by the way could be lessened if he would make his instructions clear and stop changing them every 2 days without announcement. He makes frequent grading errors and refuses to help unless you confront him several times. (continued below)"
12090,"She is a hard teacher, and her attitude and approach is wrong. she may have her degree in special services but she doesnt know anything about it."
12234,"Mr. Hollands class is definately enjoyable and interesting. He isn't the best teacher at WRHS, but you canget an A in his class easily, if you study and do notes. Just be diligent and not tardy, he dislikes those who are tardy. He has a pretty high threshold for tolerance too as people act up in his class all the time, i've only seen him get mad once, but it was a serious incident. All in all not good teacher, but chill person. Just study and you'll be fine"
12377,Mr.First is by far the worst teacher Ive ever had. He talks way too much and makes the honors students work much harder than the regular education students.
12521,"She has a very interesting way of teaching, and evidently it doesn't pay off. Talking to many students, she isn't very popular amongst them."
12665,She is rude and talks down to both students and parents.She doesn't demonstate Christian values.She favors some families even though their kids are mean.
12809,"Ms. Cody is honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She did not return any papers with exception to the research paper and the comments on their lacked clarity and did not progress me to the appropriate level for high school because I was not taught the necessary things to succeed. She would often times not grade things and give you a 100% in the grade book which sounds great, but it will be terrible for high school. She constantly makes up false stories many of which are illogical."
12953,This teacher is the worst i have ever had to deal with! My child hates him and his teaching and hates going to his class on a regular basis!
13097,"My advice to anyone who has him, immediately switch out. Unless you are willing to put double, maybe even triple, the effort, you will not do well in his class. He does not care for his students. He has no concern whether or not you are understanding the material. Wyler never clarifies information or elaborates. He is the worst teacher I ever had while in the school."
13241,"i dont understand why her ratings here are so high either. She has seemingly useless notes, squawks at her students who ask for help, really unwilling to give herself extra work. She picks favorites, judges and misjudges easily, and has the fakest personality of anyone I have ever met."
13385,"Mr Nathan is the worst guidance counselor I've ever met. He is unfriendly and extremely unhelpful. My son tried to contact him through many ways, and nothing was accomplished. He doesn't answer the phone, and doesn't return emails. He was very difficult. He never gave any good advice. A guidance counselor is supposed to help and guide you. He does not do that. There are so many bad experiences I can't list them all here. I can't believe Mr Nathan is still there, he should have left long ago!"
13529,"My experience wasn't as pleasant as I thought it would be. She seemed like a good teacher at the beginning, but after the first week, my thoughts quickly changed. She not only treats her students like peasents, she never goes over the homework, and her knowledge and clarity is horrid. I only managed a A by looking up the stuff and asking my parents about the topic. I have never been treated with any less respect in my life, and I highly recommend a different teacher."
13673,"Not very nice, immature, bad at math. Was downright cruel to my friend for the whole year for no reason. Hope she stops teaching."
13817,"maybe she has changed, but 4 years ago, this woman was the worst teacher at swanson. there were three parents in my class alone that came in to complain about how rude she was to their child. she didn't teach us anything in addition to that. she just yelled at us the whole time. she threatened to cut off a guys hair (hoenst to god she wasnt kidding). i learned nothing and very much dislike her"
13961,"Mrs. Werner is one of the worst teachers I have ever had, she prides herself on failing students, and purposely makes tests harder so kids don't get A's. She assigns vocab chapter at a time giving students upwards of 3 hours homework on some nights. I very much regret taking this class as colleges don't understand how tough she was as a teacher. On multiple tests there were more D's and F's than A's B's or C's combined. Mrs Werner leaves learing as the students responsibility"

Tests and quizzes are in depth and may have questions that were not explained before. Reasoning is difficult and simple questions about a lecture or assignment may be pushed aside, ignored, or argued by her. A class as a whole is to talk to someone about her, not just one individual."
14249,Although she is organized which is the way I like my teachers to be she is VERY demeaning! As a student I expect to have a mentor. I am there to learn. She treats us as if we are bothering her. She will argue every point even if the book says otherwise. She should NOT be a teacher. She is a perfect example of what a teacher should NOT be! Yes I am an A student but that is because of the other teachers in the GCC system and my own hard work.
