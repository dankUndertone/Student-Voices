8,Really hard... but not if you're BRILLIANT! Just remember to be BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!
16,Liberal. Enough said.. She pushes her thoughts and opinions on others by leading questions and bias information. Such a hypocrite.
25,"Imbarrato was so focused on her own opinions, she didn't listen to students. She just preaches, and it's obnoxious even when I agree with her."
33,"Amat loqui de sociali vita, quae aliquando inconveniens. Ludunt ludis omni tempore et non in fossis inveni eos. EGO sentio amo ego didici omnino nihil. Paenitet Mrs Hahn."
41,He should totally team up with Ms. Elardo. They are both Republicans and they are both very opinionated.
50,"Such a biased teacher, tries to brainwash student...Bread not bombs, shove that pin where the sun don't shine."
58,"Tried to impose his draft-dodging spinless view on the class. Not intelligent, completley out of his league compared to other teachers"
67,"Can be over opinionated, does not like.to be contradicted about opinions or if she is misinformed continues to insist only on her views."
75,"good thing she left when she did; won't be endangering any more minds here, DOES NOT know her history, biased, not a very open view on the world"
83,Your the worst and most borining history teacher i have ever had and i love history. you have ruin this year for me.
92,"he was my art/ humane letters teacher. My final for the Civil War was a crossword puzzle (Grant was the answer to two questions). During art, he couldn't even draw a box"
100,"his emotional rants preclude any rational discourse. teaching should involve a healthy exchange of ideas, but if you disagree with him, you're belittled... even though he's wrong!"
109,"Your class is drawing and painting, when are we going to paint? Oh yeah and what is up with the Kermit The Frog Doll?"
117,"She is very opinionated and does not teach objectively. If you disagree with her, you will struggle in her class."
125,"alright. the thumb is here, the index finger's here, the pinky's here, the middle finger's here, andumwhaddya call this finger again?"
134,She was different than the other gym teachers. VERY different. Very colorful. i didn't think she was aware of the dress code at schoold either.
142,"she doesnt care about you oppinion. only hers, dont try to persuade her you are ever right, she will tear you down"
151,"i thought that when you teach art, you make people love it. she does the exact opposite. very uncreavtive and dull."
159,"If you enjoy being captive to pro-socialist discussions, you will love Petek. If you hate our military, you will love Petek. If you think Capitalism is the scourge of mankind, you will love Petek. Thank you LC for pushing an agenda on you students and not allowing free thought and discussion in the classroom."
167,"I hated her class with a passion. Her opinion was the only one allowed in the classroom, and if you didn't agree with it, then you didn't matter."
176,"Her constant repitiion of the words ""ultimately"" and ""okay"" make it immposible to take her seriously."
184,"Dont touch her things, YOU'LL GET GERMS ON THEM! and if you dont want charcole on your silk shirts, then either change shirts or change prfessions! oh, and P.S. YOU NEED MORE DEMENTION!"
193,"She is horrible. She says she ""cant read pencil"". Which is such bs. GET GLASSES! She also does not wear a bra to school, and wears suggestive clothing that a school teacher should not be wearing."
201,She presents a highly biased view of history. She should make her courses more balanced. They are too feminist and left-winged now. Take the challenge Ms. Fields!
209,"Legendary Test Question: ""To what countries could I jetski to from the island of Cyprus?"" I like how Ms. Henderson decided to close the wall and ask us about our day with Ms. J after a while. rofl"
218,"Ultimately adamant with his own form of teaching. Those who don't adapt to it well fail, period. Funny, but close-minded."
226,Quality? Some people just don't get it. This man's a legend and that doesn't happen by itself. A thousand devoted students can't be wrong.
235,I believe she works us students to death on taks when taks is important yes but sat on the other hand is equally important she focuses way to much on taks.
243,"she LOVES seniors especially if the class is filled with them. she bashes underclassmen to the seniors. however, if you have your own opinion, keep it to yourself cause what you write should be her opinion =/"
251,"Has no idea that other religions even exist and he's a HISTORY teacher. Harassing. Demeaning. And serves no purpose other than to bring other christians down. Get in politics, get out of the school."
260,"Holtzdog might be a grnius, but he doesn't know how to teach. The funny hing is that he would debate me on historical facts that he totally misconstrued."
268,Do not fear alumni. She never gave me more than an 85 on anything and now I am a published writer! An 85 in her world = 100 in the REAL world!
277,"Emotional arguer rather than intellectual discusser. Taught opinion more than fact. Not open to discussion. NOT knowledgeable of history, my grad school major."
285,"Has a socialistic political agenda that he tries to sneak into class, which would be fine if he owned up to it."
293,"Mrs Fasano is narrow minded and intolerant of all views but her own. She does not explain religion, only says that if it is in the textbook then it must be true. Her class is a complete waste of time"
302,"too much hw n proj. too borin and slow. ""you have a ll the time in the world"" is just an expression!!!"
310,Awful teacher. My religion class turned into a political debate class because he could not separate his political opinion from teaching. His also is not dedicated during the class prayer which is very disappointing for person that teaches religion class.
319,she is such a weird person. u dont get a good grade unless u share her opinion on things. a teacher is supposed to be open to other ideas.
327,worst drawing teacher i ever had. he has no creativity what so ever. and he's very rude. he ruined drawing for me forever. im a decent artist but he gives you no option to be creative about your assgi
335,"Does not appreciate greatness, or for that matter eccentricity. Does not understand History is diverse in its intepretation. Should read textbook, and you will be alright."
344,mr. balistreri is innapropriate in the classroom setting and has no ability to relate to students. he shoves his opinions on everyone and has no respect for diverse views.
352,She made me feel like I wasn't good at art and she didn't appreciate my piece in fashion. didn't really value time we had in class
360,"This teacher likes to tell us that only her opinion counts, and if we disagree with her in literature then we are wrong"
369,She doesn't accept any opinion but hers. Proving her wrong is impossible in her eyes. Not very fun or flexible with her units. SWITCH OUT NOW.
377,after going to a different school and comparing one history teacher to her i am convinced that she is one of the worst teachers i have ever had. very nice- oh yes. but unorganized & has no authority
386,"She sux. she cant even pronounce terms right. Her information is biased, she forces her religious beliefs on students.Theres a reason 4 sparating church & state"
394,"when i had her, she basically graded everything based on 1) whether she liked you, 2) if she agreed with your opinion"
402,We R chapin... lets get real we have always been chapin and he is not going to change that.. where is a poem for that one??
411,"Ms. Poth handed me an essay back today, and on the paper it said that I did not have size 12 font. I most certainly did have size 12 font; I compared it to everybody else's who had size 12 font and I double-checked on my computer when I got home. I would rather sit through an extremely boring regular English class than continue her class. She is extremely uptight and she will not accept an opinion (or fact) different than what she believes. She should not be a teacher."
419,"Very Stubborn women, has lots of favorites and likes only those who view the world she does. ITS ALWAYS HER WAY OR NO WAY AT ALL."
428,Made me hate art. Who did she think she was? I was lucky to get accepted in to art school after the garbage she taught me.
436,"WOW Mrs. Kissinger needs a chill pill. During Civil War studies, she made us shout ""Yes sir!"" when asked a question and gave us points for how loud we shouted."
444,"I would write a rage review, but it would exceed 500 characters. To keep it short, Ms. Boteilho is the worst teacher I ever had."
453,"She is unfair, and doesnt stick to what she says. She bases her opinion of you on what others say. She is not a nice woman."
461,He's quick to foist his own political views upon students when he should just let them choose for themselves like an actual govt/eco teacher should.
470,Biased. Can't make up her mind about her ideas. Seems to claim that other people are less open minded than her... not true. Not very smart.
478,Exactly as the person below me said. I once was graded down for having an opposing political stance. Do not teach politics if you can't be objective about your teachings and respect others opinions.
486,"I agree with these negative reviews and then some. While other teachers read/teach classics, you get a choice in her class of Flight or The Red Tent, but it doesn't matter because no one reads the books anyway."
495,Just aweful. The worst kind of teacher. If I had listened to her I wouldnt be where I am today on top of the world! I would never allow her to teacher my kids. EVER.
503,"worst teacher i have ever had by far. feminist who does not tolerate anyone else's views, and to get a good grade, you have to pretend to have the same political views. also very arbitrary"
512,I am very dissapointed with this teacher and his beliefs that he pushes onto his students. Monogomay and his personal beliefs should not be intorduced into the classroom!
520,She spends way too much time gosipin with people than teaching then expects us to pull this information out of thin air.....and get everythin right on the hw
528,"I find him to be really hypocritical. He says he's all about thinking for one's self, yet he can't take any criticism or reasonable disagreement without being defensive and constantly tries to force his opinions down our throats. He hears only what he wants to hear."
537,"her class is too tough... she tells you that you just read whats on the top and to read what the ""underlying theme"" is, and then when you do, its ""too deep"""
545,Mrs. Peacock is one of the most vile Dean I have ever met in my entire life. She is very discriminatory and holds very conservative beliefs which are very prevalent if your dress coded.
554,"Her global studies class is an atrocity of the human spirit, it's the real global issue."
562,"Brown is a sweet lady, but she is out of her league when it comes to teaching art in a high school setting. At times a bit closed-minded, Brown is rarely helpful and often forgetful."
570,"TTM... twardy's tape mix. pumpin iron to mortal combat, and of course the classic... its raining men. 30 sec break. go!"
579,"not open to the opinions of others. self-righteous. i honestly believe she believes she's running things the right way, yet almost all students dont like her ""regime""."
587,She has biast ideas on subjects in civics and teaches her own ideas. She had us watch all these news stations BUT FOX news which is the only conservative one.
596,"She doesn't care what your opinion is if it's different than hers! She told our class, ""oh stop arguing, just agree with me!"" I haven't offended her in any way she picks on me and takes my grade down!"
604,he is way to closed minded and will put anyone down if they do not have the same beliefs as he does. judges everyone and is very unclear and always needs to be right. but deep down is a good person
612,"During Creative Writing, she'd have us draw cards with markers for holidays, or write poems which wouldn't be read. She'd gossip wth the popular kids while we wasted our time."
621,WORST TEACHER EVER! she can take all of her 20 lb packets and her evil laughs and shove 'em......where the sun doesnt shine...
629,"wen it tym 2 teech...itz tym 2 teach, wen it tym 2 cook...itz tym 2 cook, dont do them both @ da same time!"
638,"I was one of the parents who she would actually allow to help out, and I can say not one good word about this woman's true character."
646,"She has analyzed thousands of poems, shorts, and novels but I doubt she has experienced a single one. And that Mrs. Boswell is what writing and literature is truly about."
654,"I agree, what's with the lab coat? he even wore it for NHS when evry1 else had suits on... also, why didnt u go to nam? u got ""physically sick?"" yea right"
663,"You are the best...love you..P.S.I had you two years ago...I made CACX in your eco class, the project...You rock!!"
671,"I've never been in a class before where I haven't learned a single thing the entire year, but Euro with Mr. Witmer proved me wrong. He doesn't teach, skips important events in history (i.e. World War II and the Holocaust) and is extremely confusing."
679,This guy could never survive in the real world. He could never teach in a tough school. He is in la la land.
688,"""RUBIN RULES!""...""The wheels of learning must keep turning""... and gotta appreciate how the lipstick always matches the outfits... ugh spare me."
696,Mr. Garmoe is a strange man. He doesn't do anything related to music outside of school which makes me question his passion. His word choice in class is utterly ridiculous and incorrect.
705,"don't let him intimidate you. if you disagree with what he says, debate him. i do every day and i'm probably one of his favorite students. long live liberals!"
713,He judges his students a lot. I don't believe I learned much from him... He judged me on the first day (and was completely wrong) Perhaps he just reads everyone like characters in a book
721,He disagreed with alot of my opnions and couldn't agrue for squat so he had my counselor remove me. In other words he couldn't take the heat.
730,worst human being in the world. why is she around? she must've qualified for her pension decades ago.
738,mr. bergen is a reall push-over!. he cant teach.. and he doent even kno sum students names!.. in my opinion.. worst teacher ii ever had!!
747,"Couldn't stand this guy. One of those people who believes in everyone but doesn't accept those who disagree with him on certain issues. Don't try to be smart in his class, it will go over his head."
755,"the class is kinda brainwashing sometimes. I sometimes kinda felt that the cirriculum relates historical facts correctly in general, but sometime purposely overexaggerates some facts and only partially realtes others. that gives you a wrong idea about things. although i dont think its her own fault. more like the program isnt the best."
763,"What does she do every day, besides stick her nose into others business. She tries to be a counselor, yet has absolutely no qualifications. She is just a joke. Try to avoid her."
772,DID SHE HAVE TO DO THE MARRIAGE PROJECT!!! SHE HAD NO POINT IN DOING IT!!! AND SHE IS THE WORST MATCH MAKER IN HISTORY!!!
780,"a blind art teacher? he can still draw, but is not the least bit observant, helpful, or engaging. a waste of time, youre better off drawing for yourself."
789,"Easy A as long as youre socialist or communist. For those who love America, believe in capitalism, and celebrate July 4th, be prepared to get your grade docked"
797,Wilcox is a nice man but deep-down he's a misogynist who doesn't think about the impact of his words.
805,"Hes a very good person, but hes so boring, and his analogies stink, and he pushes his glasses up his nose too much."
814,"""I lost my thoguht"" with her eyes clothes while i fell asleep, she is the worst of worst teachers EVER in GFS history"
822,He randomly makes things up and has an inferiority complex-always needing to be better than his debaters. It is the consensus of all the senior debaters.
831,"If she doesn't like your opinion, watch out. It's her way or the highway, no room for interpretation in literature (can you believe it?).Unfair and hypocritical"
839,I love how you grade homework and ur clothes rock but u never explain stuff very well and ur always cranky
839,I love how you grade homework and ur clothes rock but u never explain stuff very well and ur always cranky
856,"she is a horrible teacher. never in class. i had her last year. most of the class isnt american literature, but black history and black literature. she=bad"
873,"Super liberal teacher. Also has some socialist views. If you ever have him as a teacher and you're a conservative, just swallow your words and let him say what he wants to say. If you get on his bad side or he finds out you have opposing views, he'll make it his goal to fail you. Just some words of wisdom."
889,He is incoherent in his lessons. He mumbles to himself and asks himself rhetorical questions. He picks only on certain people. I loathe him.
906,he looks like a child molester and tells girls they are out of dress code when they are practically wearing turtlenecks and knee length dresses.
923,"Dr.Casdin teaches writing from his perspective, and in his persepctive his idea is the ONLY right one. Good ideas aren't deep enough and deep ideas don't have enough evidence and ""don't dive into the text.""To Dr.Casdin everything is a parallel except for what he says, and good interpretation is just that nd not an argument; when in reality you could say that about anything"
940,Why would anyone in their right mind would wanna hire NEY. he talk too much about unrealated subject and he's a hypocrite.
957,He means well but pushing his socialist agenda on students does no good. To be honest he has much to learn in life. He has no life experience but thinks he knows it all. He needs to go out in the real world and stop repeating his anti American socialist garbage.
973,"When you ask honest questions but he thinks you are questioning his authority, he will go off on you. He only shows the side that he agrees with when talking about controversial issues and disowns you in front of the class if you dis agree with him. He is also known to have HUGE anger issues and sometimes swears in class."
990,"EXPRESSES HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS WAYYY TOO MUCH IN CLASS TO TRY AND PERSUADE US INTO THINKING LIKE HIM. teases too much, too many tests."
1007,she couldn't teach.. and she'd lick her fingers and picked up the little garbage and used the same finger and licked again to pick some more garbage..(repeat)
1024,"I had her a few years ago, and she pushes her political propaganda throughout her classes. People like this have an agenda and should not be teachers."
1040,"Absolute tool. Extraordinary opinion of himself and of his own opinions; no room for disagreement or variety of idea. To say nothing of his inability to relate to students, teachers, or (most notably) alumni"
1057,"""It's mad brick out, yo...word is bonded"" I have some very interesting memories: he hid behind a tree to escape a dog and also lifted weights to impress a girl."
1074,"she promised to give us an A for the quarter for making it to the state's for History Day but didn't follow through with her word - has a great degree of favoritism, sadly I wasn't hers and suffered"
1091,When ur taking a beginning class she expects to know how to draw She grades u on on how right the drawing is not the best to ur ability and knowledge
1108,"If you are one of her favorites, you are ok. she pushes back paper dead lines a lot. the book discussions do NOT prepair you for the tests and quizzes. There is basically no way to prepair for them and they are tough."
1124,"she yells at every class about how they are the worst class she's ever had, tells us we're destined for mediocrity, shouts at us in greek, ect."
1141,all i can say about this guy is WOW...... he doesnt tech us anything and ur oblique drawings have to be all PERFECT. he fricken fell asleep in class wit his mouth wide open.
1158,"if your drawing is not realism, landscape, or ridiculously abstract... good luck with your scores =___= oh - and his lectures and his omg why didn't you work is so true..."
1175,"nice person. i love talking about current events, but his class was overload and didn't ever learn anything about history. makes up grades to try to motivate you which totally sucks. would be great for a discussion seminar class on current events, but have to teach yourself APUSH."
1192,SWITCH OUT NOW unless u like having to debate for your grade that u truly deserve while she tries to fail u
1208,"He got the weirdest shoes. His face and eyes are very alarming. I feel like he doesn't take people's comments and ideas seriously because he does not acknowledge what people contribute to the discussion. He contributes his own ideas, and doesn't continue the discussion from students' ideas. He seems like an okay person, but just a confused teacher."
1225,"shes nice, but she doesn't teach you ANYTHING, she draws stick pictures and calls it a day, and optional homework, come on!"
1242,Her voice and constant sitting down-ness made me fall asleep and or dootle pictures of little reindeer prancing about the russian country side...and I sat in the first row...
1259,dont evn get me started on this teacher she is the wost teacher she did not evn no anything we all had the same answers on the final we must of showed her the same homework 4days
1276,"All Hat; No Cattle--Overpromises/Undelivers consistently: ""Yes-Sirs you to Death"" Ambitious Pawn being played like a violin by Board of Education."
1292,strange character. Sucky teacher and should retire. He was a nice guy with no character and students find him bland and boring. He enforces an uptight no talking environment that causes students to become uninterested in hist
1309,"Class discussion was the only interesting part of Sociology, and even that was frustrating. She has an agenda when she goes into a discussion, and if you stray from it, she overlooks what could be very good, very helpful points from the students. She's terrible at writing test questions."
1326,"Worst art teacher in the world. She never explained well and even if we made a small, careless mistake on our art, she'll yell and criticize. Btw this art class is boring so good luck."
1343,"She is amazingly picky, and grades on a ""gut feeling"". I used to get As in everything in English and in her class I get C's. She also has ""Discussions"" Where the only right opinion is her own."
1359,he definately favors people that agree with him. his tests literally have nothing to do with anything that was ever discussed as he only talks about women joining the priesthood...
1376,"Kelleher is a character. She is definitely unique in the world of teachers. A great class to have, due to the insane amount of movies watched."
1393,she knos her math but not the students. Too many other things going on. If I don't joke around its like I dont exist
1410,"ECCENTRIC. Useless when it comes to critiquing art, b/c she thinks everything is great. I had her for two consecutive years and improved not at all. But get her to like you and she'll let you do w/e."
1427,She could very well be the most incompetant teacher I have ever had in my life. The fact that she is allowed to prepare students for an AP test is mind-boggling. I hope that you read this Smith.
1443,"Widely thought of as a ""MUS legend,"" Norman Thompson falls short of his reputation as an English teacher. Whenever he assigns a test or paper, he makes sure that he has a ""doctor's appointment"" right after school for every day until that deadline. Word of advice- avoid his classes."
1460,loser man and very very VERY fat and bald hate him he is useless worthless talentless and can not direct he is garbage GARBAGE I SAY
1477,hes rude and doesnt except others opinions. worst class i've ever had. mean to students. the shakespeare freak just needs 2 leave n not look so sketchy
1494,"all she talks about is volleyballl, she said ashokan was fun i hated it. she yelled at me because i wore a guns n' roses shirt"
1511,"Mrs. Sansone led the easiest sociology class ever. However, she is extremely opinionated and makes no effort to remain unbiased during class discussions. She lets everyone know her feminist liberal beliefs and doesn't worry about offending anybody. I couldn't stand her personally just because she said that stay-at-home moms are ""disgraces to everything that feminists have worked for"". I think my mom is a pretty amazing person to be honest... Also she doesn't answer questions, which was pretty annoying."
1527,"Worst history teacher ever. According to him we nuked Tokyo Japan during WWII, and he is such a HUGE democrat, gets things wrong, and its june, doesn't know 90% of our names. Lawrence runs the show"
1544,"She is really nice and chill but her class is almost too easy. if you pay attention to her during notes (which along with videos are the only things we do) you realize she is not making sense. Also on her homework you can write whatevery you want and she gives you credit for it
for example: define the Berlin Wall: this was the last line of defense for the Daleks in their war with Darth Vader and Captain America. we seem to fly by topics barley spending 3 days on world war 2 and less than a day o"
1561,You don't learn in his class...stupid misc. random art projects like making newspaper masks..his class is a joke. Gives the impression he's nice but he singled me out/picked on me.
1578,"you can tell that she randomly decided on day to teach art. she is not passionate about it at all. and her grading system is up to her personal liking. if you are serious about art, don't take her."
1595,"She switched to World History recently, but still teaches in C&C. She will pass you if she likes you, she will debate you if you don't agree. She doesn't teach, she just assigns. She is one of the worst teachers at Enloe. I tell freshmen constantly not to take WHAP with her and the first week they said I was wrong, but by interims they totally agreed."
1611,"Let's be completely honest. Almost every word that comes out of his mouth annoys me. I now get annoyed from hearing the words hatefulness, ripple effect, domination, bubble effect, etc. And today, he said he is ""the easiest teacher in the building."" Yeah right. I swear, he talks about freakin' math in history class. HISTORY CLASS. He barely makes sense. This keeps up, we might as well fail the AP History Exam and the class itself. I should have taken Humanities."
1628,"I'm generally not too picky about teachers, but I really did not like Mrs. Colletti-Houde...she's just not good with high school kids and doesn't really accept views that differ too much from her own. Avoid if possible."
1645,"Ms. Luongo is a fun teacher, but she's not very helpful in teaching us. I have ceramics with her this year, and had art with her last year. She usually demonstrates what to do and helps in art, but ceramics, we watch a video and the we're expected to make something nice. She doesn't grade harshly at all. She gives you about three guide lines to follow, and if you do that, you get 100%. I like ceramics because I get to make fun stuff, not because of the teacher."
1662,"easiest class i have ever taken. however, mrs harmon doesnt do ANYTHING. she gives you a theme. lets you 'pick lessons' (then bashes you for them and changes them around until she likes them)"
