59,"she doesn't teach AT ALL. the class is so off topic. we have tests, and most of the material on it we never learned."
119,we have tests almost every class and we fail every one of them.... we go through chapters in less than a week... how are we supposed to learn anything if she teaches too fast???
178,He puts stuff on tests that were never in our notes. I am wondering HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS. i wonder why everyone is failing his class...
238,"MR.Russo can not teach for his life. The whole year i had him I learned NOTHING. His class was easy to pass, but i didn't learn anything new."
297,Ms. Gaudio is a horrible teacher she does not teach you anything her tests do not match what she teaches you...EVERYONE WILL FAIL THIS CLASS
357,Very easy class but don't expect to learn anything. Lots of busy work. May have difficulty on exams because she has not taught what is on it very well.
416,I dont like ms.capers .I would never recommend her . She gives people 0 for nothing . Theres thing on tests that we never learned
476,doesn't teach you anything! all he does is give you worksheets and he just looks at his computer all day. he's even too lazy to teach you anything that he gives you test answers! no one in my class le
535,"Busse expects you to read the chapters he covers, but he won't tell you that. He doesn't teach you everything on the test. Read the book and you will pass his class. Inappropriate and funny. Good guy."
595,she won't teach some things becasue she's morman. She had us draw spaghetti and bacteria. And we failed our final! What a rip off! Dingbat!
654,"I did not learn a single thing in this class this year. I feel like I missed out on learning about chemistry.The finals are coming up in her class and none of us feel prepared for it. We never learned a single thing in this class. She never taught us anything, we can barely hear what she's saying at times, and come the test she puts things we barely learn on thereThis is the only class that I am very worried about. It does not help that she's making the final very hard when she taught us nothing"
714,SHE DOES NOT TEACH! She expects us to know everything so we all fail our tests which has nothing on it that she fought us.
773,"Mr.Young is not a teacher, that man hardly comes to class. I think I wouldnt miss anything if i skipped class everyday because we never learn anything!"
833,he pretty much just gives you a math exam every 2 weeks without teaching you anything and you just pray to god you don't fail.
892,had her for frosh sci AND h. bio there is no way i will ever take any other class she teaches no matter what
952,No idea why she's teaching AP Bio..does not know anything except for what's in the textbook/ppts. Can't spell for her life. Moody and unpredictable. Self-study class with extremely difficult quizzes/tests.
1012,eep! What can i say! She's an AT bio teacher that hardly teached anything.. i learned from the textbook for gods sake! And she tests us pn things we never learned!
1071,"She doesn't help anyone in my class learn and her lessons are repetitive and boring. In her class, we have never done anything except notes and tests."
1131,The lady hasn't taught us anything all year. She just gives us webquests and expects us to memorize the material for the quizzes she gives us (and messes up on).
1190,Didn't teach anything didn't tell us when she posted hw and Test were never anything she taught us
1250,"i wish helen vendler was never even born, would have made this class a lot more tolerable. he doesn't prepare you adequately for the AP test and just gives you a lot of busy work. you have to prepare"
1309,"SO LAZY -- never taught anything, never took anything up, made us do huge assignments she never read."
1369,"she is very unclear, also she does not give out study guides for final exams. She expects us to reread all 12 chapters and memorize for the final exam."
1428,"She ""taught' science, but didn't reallly know any phys sci (just some bio) and didn't care enuf to learn so she could teach us even tho that was part of the req. lessons."
1488,I hated her class. She didn't teach us much and what she had us do was busy work more then anything else. She yelled at random people even though they didn't do anything.
1547,"All the class does is google questions for labs or exams. If we do this all the time, how are we actually learning?"
1607,"easy class if you're self motivated, she teaches nothing; wait for Coach Tonn next year and he'll teach you what she fails in"
1666,"She is nice, but she gets off topic all the time and we never learn anything. She hardly ever teaches."
1726,"made me look so stupid infront of the whole class. doesnt teach anything, so with tests everyone fails"
1785,"Is funny, but not a good teacher. Most students dont pass the AP exam or barely will. Doesn't give you enough information to actually pass the tests. SWITCH OUT."
1845,"Not a good teacher at all...I was very disappointed with what she did with my son. He claims that he did not learn anything in the class, and that everything in the class was self-taught."
1904,all we do is graphic organizers and read from the textbook!!!!!!! we have a test like every other day and we have to read the material on our own in 1 day!!!!!
1964,those who like her because she never teaches in the class; always off topic; I put on my headphone on for the whole cycle and she never noes; worst teach I had
2024,"She has the students grade tests, so everyone knows what everyone's scores are. She does not teach the material in a timely manner."
2083,"His class was easy, but he was very lazy and we never did or learned anything at all. He was a nice person, but not a very good teacher."
2143,"Not a good teacher, doesn't teach you anything from what will be on tests"
2202,She doesn't teach us anything. We do the learning at home. We watch videos instead of her actually teaching us like a teacher. She basically is just suprivising us.
2262,"She likes the llllllllletter lllllllll. And she taught us that reserved powers are SET ASIDE!!! Also, she didnt teach much. All she did was give pop tests, open book."
2321,this teacher is not a good teacher. Everyone fails her class and tests.Even though she lets us re-tests she will make it harder and make people fail.She really needs to learn how to teach better. Thx
2381,She is a horrible teacher. Reads from the textbook a lot. N u forget everything after the class ends anyways.
2440,"A pretty awful teacher. She teaches to the state test only, and all you do is read books, and vocabulary. No analysis. Always a ""lecturing"" class, never a discussion. Her tests are memorization only."
2500,"Honestly she never really ever teaches us anything. She is off topic lecturing about things we don't need and don't care about at all - on and on. She constantly gives us loads of homework everyday, which would make sense if she was teaching us the materials, but she only gives us textbook work. You really wouldn't learn if you didn't read the book. She also brings these awful magazine clippings almost every. She shows us things and lectures us on them when they have nothing to do with the class"
2559,lightin up and learn how to smile and do something besides notes and stay on one thing rather than a diffrent thign every day and than a test every friday
2619,"She gives difficult tests, and hardly prepares u for them, and doesnt dwell on one learning target for more than a day. She'll also go harder on u if she doesnt like u. Switch out b4 its 2 late!"
2678,"doesnt teach very well in class because she cant control her students, so make sure to try to learn the information on your own before tests, because if you fail a test your grade goes wayyy down."
2738,She gives us worksheets from the Internet and YouTube videos to watch. We play clash of clans in class and she says nothing. Not sure she actually knows chemistry.
2797,"He really never taught anything, like someone else said, you had to do everything on your own. This class was really difficult to learn in"
2857,All she is about is MLA. She couldn't give a ____ about anything else. Her tests are about the things in a story that DONT matter. Her projects are poorly planned and the expectations aren't well layed out at all.
2916,"This class is very useless, and you do not learn much in class. All you do is worksheets that have nothing to do with the chapter tests, most students fail for that reason. If you take this class, and choose not to drop out, you should SELF STUDY.-wrrv"
2976,Mrs. Kluge is never prepared; rarely knows what she is talking about and has NO control of her class.
3036,"Please do not take that teacher. he is no help for his students, he doesn't give any study guides to help at tests, his exam are horrible it's like nothing you study are on the test. he's gonna tell you to buy the online guide don't buy he's making you waste your money, before the semester ends half of the class will drop. His final is from chapter 1 to 15 and he add to more chapters. He expect you to know everything on the book. If you one of the students that cannot study a lot DON'T TAKE HM."
3095,Herr G never fully explains what we are supposed to be doing for practice in class. He announces having a test the day before it and barely explains what's on it.
3155,He can't answer questions because he doesn't know the material himself... I bet if he took all the tests he gives out he would fail each one
3214,"Could be such a great class if it wasn't for all the notes she makes you do. She barely teaches and when she does, it's extremely insufficient for tests."
3274,she gives the most hardest tests and quizzes I have ever seen in my life. She barely helps us and review for her quizzes. The alchemist is also the worst book in the world. Please don't teach anymore.
3333,i don't know if she's improved but she didn't know anything about teaching last year and thus I learned nothing. Chem can't only be taught from a book.
3393,"Probably one of the crappiest teachers I have ever had. He doesn't do anything, ever. He just gives us worksheets or other busy work while he just gets on the computer."
3452,"The only reason I did semi well on the AP test was because of Darnell, not Knapp. Did we ever take a test in his class? The unicorns also scare me."
3512,"she never taught us anything, all she ever did was give us stupid bookwork. shes really nice sometimes. but w.e. we ended up doing every asignments over and over again."
3571,"Her class is easy. But she DOESNT TEACH. At all, she writes on the board tells you to copy it. And her notes dont go with anything on the tests. TERRIBLE TEACHER."
3631,Can be a really nice person but doesn't seem to know the material she teaches. Tests and quizes are impossible.
3690,"He never helped anyone unless it was a football player (he gives them A's even if they dont understand the material). He doesnt prepare you for the final, and if you have him, all he does is powerpoints that are not helpful, and then he gives out worksheets that dont make any sense! Terrible teacher!"
3750,"The amount of crazy flowing through her brain is at such a huge amount at any time of the day. Not only does her whole entire lesson come from the textbook but you also get tested every week, and some weeks you can even get tested on every single day! This teacher is the reason im not taking spanish next year."
3809,o man. this teacher is ridiculous i mean she never admits when she is wrong which is definitely most of the time!!
3869,this class is horrible. she just read off of powerpoints and puts information on the tests she never talked about. its extremely difficult to get a good grade on her tests.
3928,"She is by far the worst teacher i've had, first of all she does not teach at all and her tests have nothing to do with what she teaches, she taught us an entire section that was half the final in 2 days. Although she is nice, you do not learn anything in that class."
3988,Terrible teacher. Gives you A's on all of your drafts and then a C on the final copy. I didn't learn anything.
4048,"he sucks. he is completely ridiculous about ""cheating"" and it his lectures make you fall asleep. The most monotone teacher ever!"
4107,"scribbles a bunch of stuff across the board, which is not easy to copy down for studying, and then exects you to know the minutae of it on the test. bring a tapedeck to tape the class."
4167,"Mrs. McKee's APUSH class is a complete joke. You will have to do pretty much no work, and you should easily be able to get at least an A doing little to nothing. She will never quiz you, although she might threaten to. Also, she knows pretty much nothing about APUSH. If you want to pass the AP test, you're going to have to disregard everything she says and make your own study plan. I'm not sure why she's still a teacher."
4226,"She is not a very good teacher, I'm afraid. I managed to go through her class without taking the final test, and without even reading the book. I think I got an A..."
4286,i think mrs. pyle is a bad teacher. she doesn't teach us good lessons and we don't learn much. she expects us just to do the homework and then we will know everything. she should teach the class more and have more control over the classes. she makes it a difficult way of learning and i haven't learned much and failed the tests. i htink she hsould give us review sheets for the tests because most of her students in the class are failing the tests and they're hard without review sheets or good lessons!!
4345,"worst teacher ever, never taught, worksheets everyday, never lectured, i haven't leaned anything, he is mean and not friendly. a waste of time."
4405,"Doesn't put much effort in teaching you, will quiz you on stuff she never taught. Will talk about any student (behind their backs) to other students."
4464,"I took APES with him... it was a disaster. All we did was watch movies all year, then closer to the AP exam he deciders to rush and ""teach"" us all the stuff he missed. It's ridiculous. He is lazy and most classes i just sat there with nothing to do. He is a nice guy, but a terrible teacher. You have to teach yourself all of the information."
4524,He's a pretty tough teacher and doesn't really teach very well. His tests DO NOT match what he teaches in class. He also goes overboard with assignments and pop quizzes
4583,"Mrs Boynton is very nice and understanding but her notes were confusing, her tests were random, and I didn't feel prepared for the exam"
4643,"she doesn't prepare you for the Ap exam at all. Gives you months to finish an assignment. Didn't have any tests for the whole year, and she rarely gives out homework. You don't have to try to get an A in her class, but you'll fail the exam if you don't self study."
4702,awful teacher. every day she gives us a work sheet and then we take a test. she never taught us anything all year. jsut worksheets followed by test
4762,She moves through the chapters too fast and doesn't explain anything and she gives us a test every week. Do you think this is fair?
