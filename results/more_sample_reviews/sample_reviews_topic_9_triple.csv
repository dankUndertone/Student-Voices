37,"Do not, under any circumstances, take her class if you actually have some desire to learn chemistry. You'd learn more in a level 2 class, all her class will teach you is to hate chemistry"
75,I honestly feel that a skipped sophmore year English because I learned virtually nothing in that class.
113,"90% of the class is about himself, 10% is about physics. I learned more teaching myself than in his class. Unless you want your GPA to suffer, avoid his physics class at all costs!! It's sad that he is the only physics teacher in Gab. This guy should be fired and replaced,"
151,"her class was a waste of time.and i was in ap.we learned nothing b/c she taught nothing.if i hadn't had ms allan, i'd be scared to death of college."
189,I learned nothing in his class. Everything I learned was on my own time. Being in class was a complete waste of time. I actually think I would have learned more not being there.
226,"ok, I learned nothing in this class and it was a waste of time. you have no clue how much I wanted to be transfered out of it. complete waste of my life."
264,She had no organization to her class and lost papers all the time. The other English classes learned so much more than we did. I hope I don't flunk out next year after having her.
302,I am pretty sure teachers are supposed to TEACH you. I was looking forward to this class the entire time I have been at East Lake and now that I am this class it is a complete disappointment. A waste of a class.
340,"Worst teacher in history. If you want to have easy A, take Smryl's AP Physics Class. Don't take regular, because there is no difference between the two classes."
378,"By far the easiest class I've ever had, a disappointment since it was supposed to be the most advanced English class at B'wood. She taught us nothing, and showed considerable favor to the males."
416,I had him for AP Psychology. He isn't helpful at all and doesn't stay on task. I learned more about the soccer team than psychology in his class!
453,She does not do what she says she will. I did not learn anything from her the entire semester.
491,"Her class was, in a word, painful. I struggled all semester, yet somehow ended up with an A in Precalc. I transfered out at semester to Mr. James' class.."
529,"Learned absolutely NOTHING,I'm going to be totally lost in spanish 2,worst teacher I've ever had,her class was a waste of time,hope u don't come back next year"
567,She's a terrible teacher. If you get her you should transfer out unless you want a long and stressful year.
605,"I got a worse grade in this class than in any AP or Honors class, switch out IMMEDIATELY when you get him. Got to AP or Honors, I'm completely serious, it'll be easier than his class. You will be teaching yourself the entire year."
642,"I had this teacher in senior year of high school in 2004. All I remember was how miserable I was, and how miserable she seemed during class. Too focused on homework stamping."
680,you dont learn anything and she's oblivious to the cheating on tests that happen in her class. the class is so far behind in history compared to other classes
718,"She made English class interesting. But, that doesn't mean I actually looked forward to seeing her or her class! She is very moody"
756,"left me completely unprepared for ap lang. there is no way she should be teaching any honors class.a nice person, but she made me want to shoot myself."
794,i learn nothing in her class....half the time i have to go on youtube or something to learn the material......
832,Imagine walking into class knowing that you are not going to lean anything for the next hour; that is Ms. Kay's English class.
869,I loathed her... and I had her for 2 freaken years... all she does is sip her coffie and read her novel...
907,i didn't learn very much in his class we spent too much time talkign about the holocost and it is depressing. i wish he challenged me more. it was fun though.
945,it's riticulous how much i dread going to his class everyday. His class is very easy but he is just very full of himself...one of my least favorite classes
983,He can't teach. I'm in his AP class and I'm struggling... We're far behind as well as compared to the other AP class. He needs a little bit of work to do.
1021,She doesn't understand that she has level classes and makes it PRE-AP English
1058,i thought that computer apps was supposed to be more than working on microsoft word and im having alot of fun doing a business biggest waste of time ever..
1096,Terrible. Did not prepare me for college at all. I'm so happy I had Lalama my senior year so I actually learned something before going into college. His teaching styles are waaayyy outdated.
1134,YOU BETTER LOVE VISUAL BASIC AND USING TEXTBOOKS CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU WILL DO IN THIS CLASS
1172,"Chris Gomez class is not one in which your child will learn much in. If your child gets his class, as a student myself, I suggest you switch them out. I have had his class, and learned nothing at all."
1210,"If not for Joliceour, nothing would have ever been done in our Comp class (Jolikaribian). Karib doesn't do anything."
1248,"Who ever is in his class. You better get extra help on English, cause You wont learn anything from his class."
1285,"Her class is too easy and she's such a HIPPIE! Literally! She's unorganized and nothing ever gets done in her class, EVER."
1323,"Its sad to think that you can go through an entire year of physics at AHS and learn absolutely nothing, but its true. Maybe teaching isnt her strength?"

1399,"Having been in Ms. Massey's English class for only one semester, I feel like I have lost knowledge. I've gained absolutely nothing from being in her class."
1437,"This guy is definitively the worst teacher I have ever had. The class did not learn a single thing from him all year long. You've heard his AP Gov class is completely useless, but his ""Contemporary"
1474,she didn't teach us at all. i am sorry that mrs. vuko had to leave. my freshmen year should have rocked. the class was wild and nothing was accomplished.
1512,"I'm a senior in Bayard's class and I've been struggling all year. He has done nothing but make things more difficult for me. He is unsupportive. If you find yourself in his class, switch out."
1550,Worst class I have ever taken in high school. So much busy work with no explanation as to how to do it.
1588,"one of the easiest, most pointless classes ive ever taken...she has no control over classes and she seems to hate me just beacuse i have an A+ in her class..."
1626,"He is the epitome of evil. I was in his pre calc stats class and i dropped because of him. He is a horrible grader, makes fun of people in class, humilaites them completely. The sad part is that you can nothing about it. DROP HIM. HE WILL FAIL YOU."
1664,"his class is a completely joke, we never do anything and he just sits down and talks. if you want an easy class take it but if you actually want to learn transfer as soon as possible!!"

1739,he talks alot about pointless things. he doesnt teach much. you dont have to do anything in his classes
1777,She is absolutely terrible. She has no clue what she's talking about 90% of the time. Switch out ASAP if you can! I got my lowest grade in English ever in her class.
1815,"Kirby has definitely created a legacy for himself. My older brother despised his class as much as I did. You learn nothing, and it's WAY to cold in his room."
1853,"OH MY GOD, NO! He was the worst substitute teacher for Pre-calc, ever. We learned absolutely nothing from him. Good for wasting time, though..."
1891,An awful teacher who strives to make class difficult. I have learnt nothing in that class. too much busy work and too little actual learning
1928,Unless you are planning to be in the plays or musical drop this class ASAP!!!!! He is horrrriiiiibbbbbllllle!
1966,"Little help for students who asked. Did almost nothing to help us learn or do better. She had no control over class. If you have her on your schedule, transfer out."

2042,"dont listen to all these people. she may be a good person, but her class is all busy work. YOU LEARN NOTHING! its is a waste of time and will ruin your life"
2080,"after you get past just the scariness of her, and actually try in her class---- she makes it very difficult to to learn."
2117,Do not take pre calc honors with him if you want to keep your sanity. This is the hardest class I've taken at Bell and he doesn't do anything to help you
2155,"I hate her! I've had SO much trouble dealing with her that I'm transferring out of her class at the end of the semester, and even though that means I will go from IDS to Regular."
2193,"I feel sorry for you if you enjoy Spanish, because being in her class will certainly change that. Like seriously take German or something don't waste your time. The class is utterly pointless, after a year I can say that I learned absolutely nothing. In fact I just forgot everything I learned previously. You're probably better off taking the AP test your junior year then dropping the class senior year. She's a very nice lady (and hilariously similar to Consuela) but has no clue what she's doing"
2231,"We didn't read or write a thing in his class, and it was a sophomore honors class. Supposed to read Romeo and Juliet and ended up watching multiple movies. If we wrote three essays that year, I would honestly be surprised."
2269,"It's the easiest class ever, but that has nothing to do with the teacher. it's the most simple class with the most simple minded teacher. A one time she spent 7 minutes trying to get us to save a physical piece of paper to our documents in the computers. At least it's an easy A"
2307,"I have learned nothing yet this year, yet I have one of the highest grades in the class. What a joke of a class."

2382,"He may know about physics, but he is absolutely useless in explaining it. His exams cover things that we never went over in class and the entire class feels entirely unprepared to take the AP tet"
2420,"Avoid her like the plague. You will be lucky to learn a single tangible and relevant thing all year, and her ideas about literature are boring. Also mean..."

2496,"Very nice man, but one learns NOTHING in his class. It seemed cool when I had him, but now I know nothing about history"
2533,We actually do NOTHING in your class... .PE teachers? Please make s do something! Oh and we have far to much time to dress out...
2571,I had her at the freshman center for orchestra and she ruined my year. She knows nothing about string instruments and caused half of us to drop out!
2609,"Unless you want to do nothing, sign up for this class. For me, I wanted to learn something and get good grades (since his classes were really easy). In return I received tons of projects that have nothing to do with the course and a bad grade (comparatively).TL;DRget him if you want a free period, not for educationget on his good side so that you aren't biased again"
2647,"He teaches alot, but in a very unsufficient manner. He makes you do alot of busy work and doesn't make you think at all. His class is easy, but it's a total waste of time. I recommend you take another"
2685,"Nice but i learned nothing. We get 4 tests a semester, each with 5 words. If you actually want to learn, don't take it. If you want a fun, ez class, take it."
2723,She packs her class with busy work and has some ridiculous mood swings. I really wish i was learning more. At least she asks for help from other teachers.
2760,Had him as a teacher and learned absolutely nothing it was honestly a waste of time and hates answering questions he has no passion for teaching and just wants to get out of tha class ASAP. I wish I Learned something in his class and it's clear that a lot of students have problems with him bcuz of how he teaches.
2798,The worst teacher in the history of pedagogy! He made an entire year of English useless to me and my peers. He's since left Liberty to plague another system.

2874,"WORST TEACHER YOU WILL EVER HAVE, COLLEGE CLASSES MIGHT BE EASIER THAN WHAT HE TEACHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE FINDS THE HARDEST WORDS TO TEACH YOU WITH!!! IF YOU GET HIM DROP AT FIRST MILLISECOND!"
2912,She doesnt get that her class isnt an honors class and half the students have AP classes where they really have to spend their time. She gives way to much hw and grades harder than she teaches.
2949,"she's a terrible teacher, you do the same thing every week for the whole year and she's really confusing and you move really fast and dont take time to actually learn things like you did in middle school. it's awful"
2987,i has her last year and i honestly did nothing. her class was a joke. she talked about her life too much and didnt teach me anything. i only learnedabout her children NOT about social studies.
3025,"He has screwed up my grade multiple times and he is not very organised, try to avoid his class if you can. It will not help you at all."
