159,"The other day in periods 1 and 2 HUM, we cam,e in about 30 seconds after the break between classes and then she talked for about 15 minutes about how we waste so much time she cant finish her lessons."

637,worst teacher ever! he tells you how to do the homework after you do it leaving you in the dark for every assignment. He tries too much to relate to kids and you can get him off topic for 45 minutes.
677,"When he's in class it's a free day because he doesn't know what he's doing. Funny guy though. He did this long, uncomfortable rant about Christianity one time, which wasted time."
717,"All he talks about is his kids, and he has no idea what he is talking about. I didn't learn anything in his class, at all."
757,"I HATE her. She called us all ""FOBS"" just because we misunderstood her question. She blames us for her mistakes and takes up class time telling stupid stories"
797,worst teacher none of her stuff makes since all she does is say you guys are whining or 5 minutes is enough time to take a test stop whining...:(
837,She knows what shes doing but rambles on to much on weird stories and other topics not concerning chem
877,Easily the worst history teacher I've ever had. He's in love with the sound of his own voice and did half of his teaching through the TV. His class is a joke.
916,"she sweats ALOT and she can't even talk because she runs out of breath too quickly, and the only art projects we do are SELF-PORTRAITS!!!!"
956,She has no idea what she is talking about. She is not funny and not knowledgeable

1036,"You make us do pointless worksheets, watch pointless movies, and study only have the vocab. Wow, you are bad."
1076,"She has no idea what is going on in the class. It's so pointless. I doubt she even knows what comes out of her mouth half the time. It's sad because she is nice, but for whatever reason shes just incompetent."

1235,We don't learn much in her class because she spends the whole period complaining about American culture.
1275,"Stiven can be remotely funny at times,but when he isnt funny, he is confusing.When you go to see him he never answers the question.In the class room he is always going on tangents"
1315,"A joke, doesn't teach. He lets numerous kids and baseball players that do not belong in his class skip to his class during class hours. I got an A yet i didn't do any work, only because i was a girl."
1355,Damm boring. Doesn't teach at all. Only tells dumb animal stories. Hate it so much. Good thing i only had him for 1 year.
1395,"Ms. Mihata's class is really easy but she doesn't teach us anything. She leaves the classroom sometimes for long periods of time to go ""reheat her coffee"", even when we are taking tests."
1435,he is a teacher that you the whole class can leave the room and he really DOESNT notice. he's at NW now!
1475,"""Chicos y Chicas"" ahhhhh jeeze ya htink she can say that enough times in one class period. she can be kool but she can be the most annoying"
1514,We left fifth grade knowing two things: She loved her dog and she loved her kids!!!!!!!!! Nothing else.
1554,"Dr. Healy Wow, All we do is sit in class and draw and listen to him talk about how proud he is of all his art and him telling us not to bother him while he is painting. Lets just call him ""different""."
1594,OK- AInsworth doesnt teach. SHe moves on without finishing a lesson - and she constantly goes SHHH even when were quiet. Nothing else but GRRRRR evil woman!P1
1634,"Basically a class with her is ~50 minutes of listening to her yelling at people when they aren't doing anything wrong, and stories about her failure children. I was not amused."
1674,She is not a good teacher. She spends more time talking about useless things and not even touching on S.S. im very unhappy to have her as a teacher.
1714,"""That's a bummer""
""How's that workin' for ya""
I talked and she gave me detention, and I it was the easiest class ever and she talks too loud"
1754,Ms. Peltier didn't know what she was talking about or we didn't know what she was talking about. She also lied to us about quiz format a few times.
1794,"the only good ratings for this man are written by him, now thats depressing. and how come he can joke but when we talk he attacks us?"
1833,"He won't tell you about assignments but all you do is say ""FOO! What are you talking about?!?! I did that assignment."" And you get 100%s."
1873,"all she does is makes us repeat ourselves, over, and over, and over again. it's just annoying. the only good thing is computer lab on wednesdays"
1913,"Mrs. Yslas had made my life a living hell. She gives way too much homework and doesn't even teach half of the stuff. She makes your life miserable, so you better pray you never get her."
1953,we side track her too!! it is so much fun!!!!!! she has no idea!! it's hilarious!! one time i asked her how to say supercalifragilisticexpealidosios!! it was hilarious and she actually said how to!! it took up about 30 minutes of the class!!!
1993,He is a joke. I'm sorry but this teacher has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to teaching a public speaking class.
2033,"Were they kidding with this one? Is she some kind of joke? Who picked her as the best teacher for our band? She couldn't keep a bunch of mutes quiet, let alone us!"
2073,she doesnt teach all she does is talk about her life and then gets mad if we don't listen... not a good teacher
2112,she is very confusing and seems to not know what she is talking about all the time
2152,"This guy the borin'est teacher in the math department, he tells stories that are irrelevant to the topic. ZZZZZzzzzzz"
2192,"This guy is literally one of the worst teachers I've ever had. His tests are okay but there are always a million typos. Whenever he'd lecture us, he'd trail off and start talking about some movie that no one has ever watched."
2232,"had him early in the morning and he literally put me to sleep, he could make his lessons more interesting and interact w/ the class but the man just cant teach period."
2272,ONE OF THE WORST TEACHERS I'VE EVER HAD. he was awful. he was on the computer or watching the news the whole time. didn't have control of his class at all. easy
2312,Awful! She goes on about her personal life and if you talk to someone else she yells at you when her conversation is pointless to you
2352,"she CAN'T teach or talk and she can't even read the text book without messing up the words, the class is a joke, and she believes everything anybody tells her...its kinda funny"
2392,"Instead of teaching the material in class he will spend most of the period going over homework while other people sleep. Then he will constantly attack you for not going to tutoring and/or missing homework. Very exasperating and dull, he just does not realize that what goes on in the classroom is just as, if not more, important then what goes on at home."
2431,"She could have been more exciting. Not very good at teaching.And she needs to stay on topic more and stop talking about her husband, family, things she likes to do and other stuff when we are trying to work."
2471,He's a confusing teacher- seems to know the subject but spends most days bragging about all this stuff that would take 100 years to do-most of the time just likes to hear himself talk.
2511,"Her entire class is basically this, ""sit down, be quiet, type random gibberish"" She is not a mean teacher, but not a fun 1 either. i just didn't like her class"
2551,mrs.strano is a tarrable teacher half the time she is to busy on her comp. and she doesnt even rlly do her job at all. also u cant do ur hw in her class just a tarrable teacher all arounddddd!!!!!!!!!
2591,"Honestly Mrs. Alegret doesn't actually teach. She just basically makes us ""study"" and learn things by ourselves and that is the worst thing a teacher can do. If your a teacher, you are being paid to TEACH. All she does is talk about her private problems and daily life and her son and husband. I have never seen her TEACH a class one full period."
2631,"he spends all of class lecturing, but his tests had little to do with the lectures. he can't relate to his students at all, and will yell at his class depending on his mood"
2671,she is a funny teacher n all but she dont explain anything... and she says she loves math and teaching it but she dont teach it... n she never shuts up about STORIES!
2710,"im sick of all this ""KAIROS is great"" babble...its a bunch of nonsense..if you got problems you dont need some psuedo-freudian rambler preachin to you.."
2750,She talks to her self constantly! Its so annoying.. she rips apart everything ne one says! Shes the WORST teacher ever!
2790,she is a terrible teacher. every class she would say to stop talking and if she even caught u whispering u would get a detention. whats up with her taking things from u to get and eraser? in the winte
2830,"okay he is nice but he is completely oblivious, i once handsed in my spanish homewrk and i got credit for it, i'm not kidding! hilarious half the class is just walk'n round during class he doesnt care"
2870,"He can be Funny at times! and Just annoying the next, he needs To be Clearer In talking and Should slow down. He needs to also go over Stuff more since its geometry!"
2910,"i agree. she doesn't tell us the specifics of the tests and quizzes and when lecturing, leaves everyone baffled. gets off track and talks about her son A LOT."
2950,"Spends literally 40 minutes of class talking about her personal life and how great her kids are, then has no time to teach what she needs to. She goes way too fast, even for an Alg. 2 hnrs. course."
2990,"Always talks about all the stuff he did at Los Alamos. Doesn't do much in class, mostly talks about himself, sometimes goes over homework problems, takes forever to grade stuff. Shouldn't teach AC."
3029,I love it when teachers talk about themselves because I can get to know them better but honestly mrs Cramer talks waaayyyy too much about her kids and her family and her random experiences that don't relate to math at all. she goes into way too much detail with every story and ends up wasting 89% of the class period talking about herself. we end up going home and doing homework we don't understand and then she just magically expects us to know all of the material by the test day.
3069,she didn't help us prepare for the AP test at all. She was too busy talking about her kids all the time
3109,I like her as a person but cmon she does no know how to work with teens. I hear her 6 hour walks all over her
3149,"i wish i had this guys job, all he has to do is sit around and play on his computer while a bunch of delinquents/tardy to first hour people sleep. it's an epic win for him."
3189,"For like the remaining 40 minutes of class, we just sit there and do nothing while hes on his laptop. He should start teaching.. instead of giving us loads of homework"
