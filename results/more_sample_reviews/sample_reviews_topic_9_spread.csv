56,I HATE HER! i learned nothing in her class and now i am struggling through honors classes in the high school and i have to catch up for all of last year
113,"90% of the class is about himself, 10% is about physics. I learned more teaching myself than in his class. Unless you want your GPA to suffer, avoid his physics class at all costs!! It's sad that he is the only physics teacher in Gab. This guy should be fired and replaced,"
170,"I believe this is referring to Chris Barth. If so, the only thing you'll learn from his class is how to color. Total waste of a year."
226,"ok, I learned nothing in this class and it was a waste of time. you have no clue how much I wanted to be transfered out of it. complete waste of my life."
283,Sometimes you just wish you had never taken a class since it was a waste of time. This is one of those classes. I did learn what melancholy meant. That's all!
340,"Worst teacher in history. If you want to have easy A, take Smryl's AP Physics Class. Don't take regular, because there is no difference between the two classes."
397,"""Honors"" isn't ""A.P.""!!! seriously, ten-fold harder than last year's honors class...you really must be dedicated to ONLY ENGLISH if you want a respectable grade"
453,She does not do what she says she will. I did not learn anything from her the entire semester.
510,"she screwed up my schedule literally 4 times in 1 yr and signed me up for classes i didnt want and claimed i wanted them and before looking at the card, she made it seem like i hacked the comp 4 them."
567,She's a terrible teacher. If you get her you should transfer out unless you want a long and stressful year.
624,"Ms. Castle gave up on me. I was in her AP Chemistry class, and seriously could not learn anything. And I'm usually wonderful in science. Now in regular Chemistry with a different teacher, doing great."
680,you dont learn anything and she's oblivious to the cheating on tests that happen in her class. the class is so far behind in history compared to other classes
737,"Mrs. Riley(Zinger) was nice, but she was a God awful teacher. I had her for two out of the 6 english classes I took at York and hers were the only classes in which I got low B's/high C's. In fact, having her my Junior year ended up discouraging me from taking AP English. I showed my essays to my English teacher this year and she pretty much called me an idiot for NOT taking AP."
794,i learn nothing in her class....half the time i have to go on youtube or something to learn the material......
850,"The class equivalent of a string documentary, of which he actually showed in class"
907,i didn't learn very much in his class we spent too much time talkign about the holocost and it is depressing. i wish he challenged me more. it was fun though.
964,"during history, we take about 15 minutes of class time to listen to the news. we should be using that time for actually learning curriculum hence why we are behind other history classes. personally, i learn nothing in that class. i learn about how great his psychology class is and listening to songs from the 1900s."
1021,She doesn't understand that she has level classes and makes it PRE-AP English
1077,he is a very unhelpful teacher and actually does grade unfairly. There is nothing uselful anyone can learn in his class.
1134,YOU BETTER LOVE VISUAL BASIC AND USING TEXTBOOKS CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU WILL DO IN THIS CLASS
1191,"The class was too easy. I didn't learn anythning the whole year. I agree with below, she just googled assignments. Nothing her own. Pretty much a study hall. Do NOT take business with her if you actually want to learn."
1248,"Who ever is in his class. You better get extra help on English, cause You wont learn anything from his class."
1304,"I hated the class when I was in there....but looking back, it was by far the best class I've ever taken at Garfield."
1361,"Not very helpful. his classes are more exercises than actual teaching. i learned nothing during tham, except for stage combat second semester..."
1418,She spent literally an entire six-weeks complaining about what bad students we were simply because a few kids in the class could not understand the material. Bi-polar. Avoid at all costs... for sanity
1474,she didn't teach us at all. i am sorry that mrs. vuko had to leave. my freshmen year should have rocked. the class was wild and nothing was accomplished.
1531,"ill put it this way. time spent ""teaching us"" about europe-100% amount of europe questions on the exam-10%"
1588,"one of the easiest, most pointless classes ive ever taken...she has no control over classes and she seems to hate me just beacuse i have an A+ in her class..."
1645,"DUARTE IS DEFINATLY THE WORST TEACHER INSCHOOL, I LEARNED NOTHING ALL YEAR AND DEFINATLY DOESNT PREPARE YOU FOR HONORS Bi learned more about tatoos and rugby than math last yr!"
1701,She had no idea what the heck she was doing. She kept experimenting pointless projects that wasted time. I learned nothing.
1758,"Great guy, funny to talk to...out of class! Not the best AP teacher, advisable to transfer out of his class regular or not."
1815,"Kirby has definitely created a legacy for himself. My older brother despised his class as much as I did. You learn nothing, and it's WAY to cold in his room."
1872,Doesn't prepare you whatsoever for college. I had to start over from scratch after I spent the first year finding out that I wasn't ready for the classes I should have been.
1928,Unless you are planning to be in the plays or musical drop this class ASAP!!!!! He is horrrriiiiibbbbbllllle!
1985,"she was soo mean to me and my friend. if you get this teacher, it would be worth switching classes because Mr. Tuomi is SO much better!!"
2042,"dont listen to all these people. she may be a good person, but her class is all busy work. YOU LEARN NOTHING! its is a waste of time and will ruin your life"
2099,"at first it was nice to have basically a free period in the middle of the day, but by 2nd quarter it was a huge disappointment. She doesn't realize the entire class takes advantage of her, it got to a point where everyone was getting passes to lunch or bcc. Switch out if you want to learn something."
2155,"I hate her! I've had SO much trouble dealing with her that I'm transferring out of her class at the end of the semester, and even though that means I will go from IDS to Regular."
2212,ive been in her class for a week and im already ready to just request a class switch. shes ridiculously boring and her voice is shrill it drives me nuts.
2269,"It's the easiest class ever, but that has nothing to do with the teacher. it's the most simple class with the most simple minded teacher. A one time she spent 7 minutes trying to get us to save a physical piece of paper to our documents in the computers. At least it's an easy A"
2325,She hates everything especially freshman i seriously hope i dont have her for english next year. everyone even skips her class bc of her. I didnt learn anything in Advanced Communications.
2382,"He may know about physics, but he is absolutely useless in explaining it. His exams cover things that we never went over in class and the entire class feels entirely unprepared to take the AP tet"
2439,Don't get Intro to Journalism. It's the most unorganized class ever wtith the most unorganized teacher ever.
2496,"Very nice man, but one learns NOTHING in his class. It seemed cool when I had him, but now I know nothing about history"
2552,You learn nothing about english in this class! One of the worst teachers ever! Everthing is very last minute with him. He will give you projects that have nothing todo with english. Final is HARD!!!!!
2609,"Unless you want to do nothing, sign up for this class. For me, I wanted to learn something and get good grades (since his classes were really easy). In return I received tons of projects that have nothing to do with the course and a bad grade (comparatively).TL;DRget him if you want a free period, not for educationget on his good side so that you aren't biased again"
2666,"Very unhepful, avoid this teacher at all costs!Will hurt you not help you IM SERIOUS! I had her for two years and i still regret ever having her."
2723,She packs her class with busy work and has some ridiculous mood swings. I really wish i was learning more. At least she asks for help from other teachers.
2779,Walking into this class i was hoping that this would be a career choice for the future. This man ruined this for me. i regret taking this class. hes a horrible teacher
2836,"I took her class as a freshman, and there was no doubt that I was smarter than her when it comes to math and common sense."
2893,"I did not learn a single concept in the Honors course I took from him. He is a nice man, but should stay in the coaching field."
2949,"she's a terrible teacher, you do the same thing every week for the whole year and she's really confusing and you move really fast and dont take time to actually learn things like you did in middle school. it's awful"
3006,"She is a hot mess, very nice person but a horrible teacher. She claims that she is preparing us for college but I learned zilch throughout the whole entire semester !!"
3063,I do not enjoy her english classe because she assigns more home work than my AP World and Honours Chem classes combined. She things she teaches you things but its up to you to teach your self complete
3120,The class was pointless the only time we worked was with subs(which we had alot) and when he was mad. Hated the class!
3176,Mr. Gibson is nice...thats not the problem. He is very strict and doesn't help a lot. His class is reuining my whole freshman year... Thanks Mr. Gibson...
3233,i have below an A in his class (regents-level). colleges will not like that because they know that regents classes are the lowest possible level in high school (even lower than regular classes).
3290,"Wow. I took her honors chem class one year, and the next year, everyone in her class was unprepared for AP chem. wow. what a terrible teacher. we don't learn anything."
3347,She really doenst know what shes doing!! she changes her lesson plan like every second.. -_- i cannot stand being in her class at all.. she grades very harshly too
3403,"Her class is extremely easy... because you don't learn anything and she won't test you on much. Her exam questions are basic and very unhelpful. If you're aiming to get a 5 on the AP Physics 1 exam, you'll have to study on your own. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had; you won't be able to learn much in class. If you wish to truly be prepared for AP Physics C, I recommend that you take Physics Honors or get tutored. Don't waste your time in this ""challenging"" AP class."
3460,"I felt extremely disappointed about art after taking this class. Yes, there were moments that were fun, but I can say I left this class not ever wanting to take an art class ever again. She had nothing nice or constructive to say, and I'll admit that class left me going home in tears on multiple occasions... If you are seriously interested in art, don't bother taking this class. Or any other art classes at Bailey Middle School."
3517,She is never there on time and we goof off a lot. I agree that a college prep class would have been a better choice than this class.
3573,"Awful teacher. I'd say 4/5 days of the week, her class is just doing nothing. She's always too busy with Districts or the plays going on. She doesn't pay attention to her classes so we just do whatever, basically."
3630,You will learn nothing in her class. She thinks she is intelligent but she knows nothing and can't teach at all.
3687,"we suspect he enjoys children the same way that micheal jackson does, if you get my drift. most horrid teacher ever; practically does not teach at all. please transfer out of his class."
3744,"I didn't learn anything from his class, I had to find the information myself. I felt that a lot of time was wasted when it could have been spent teaching us the information we needed to know."
3800,"Heh, Duff is one cool guy. Although he's gone, I had him for IPC, and he taught absolutely nothing. But he's a nice person, so I enjoyed his class."
3857,"I did not like his English class. He would be better as a philosophy-type teacher than english. He does not answer your questions straight-forward. Also, his tests are very specific."
3914,I have had nothing bad to say about teachers except for this one. I had to switch classes when I took chem in 1994!! Doesn't speak or instruct clearly! I lost interest quickly
3971,"Johnson is not clear at all, and she doesnt even write notes for her advanced classes, I would recommend switching out of her class if you get her."
4027,"If you know what is good for you, then you will NOT take AP Stats. I have learned absolutely nothing from her. The only way to get a 5 with her is to self study"
4084,All of the classes are the same. He needs to change up the curriculum to match the course. I should not have to study tractors in a flower class.
4141,I took psych AP and didn't learn a thing. I used everyday as a study hall because nothing she ever said in class was relevant. Do not take this class if you expect a 5 or even a 4 on the AP test
4198,If you want to quit your instrument- join her class. If you want to hate music- join her class. If you want to experience mental and physical torture- join her class. 'nuff said.
4254,This man watched me get tortured in his class each and every single day by other students and he sat there laughing. I didn't do anything but put my name on papers because I hated him so much. And I still managed to get an A in his class. I learned NOTHING.
4311,"Took his AP Physics class. Homework consisted of writing down notes on videos he made on YouTube. Little to no learning in class. We usually completed problems on WebAssign with occasional help from him. All in all, he seemed more like a proctor than a true teacher"
4368,I had her for one semester and then I switched out. She was very nice to me once I wasn't in her class anymore.
4424,"Nice guy but horrible teacher. I had him for Physical Science and he was horrible. We did nothing in his class and when we did, we didn't learn anything..."
4481,"Her assignments are tedious and monotonous, just as is her voice and her whole being in general. Not a very fun class at all, and I love English!"
4538,sh'e so boring and definately has personal favourites.. i hated that class so much and would advise anybody to switch out of it to another level!!
4595,"she's a know it all and not a great teacher. take civics seminar instead of honor and don't take western humanities, she teaches both"
4651,Laurie Ann needs to stop talking about her precious daughter skylar nicole...we dont care!!!!! Her class is a waste of our valuable time. Btw where is our duke certificate?
4708,"She is a very nice human and can be helpful often times when working with her one on one, but you will not be learning much from her. If you're taking a normal class for an easy a, she's the ideal teacher. If you're looking for a 5 on the AP Lang test, she isn't for you."
4765,"Her class was too easy and she didn't spend any time on Europe which was the course, because she spent the whole time on america and the holocaust"
4822,"Perkins, you crashed and burned last year in gifted history. Wow. Hope you don't teach all your classes like that...PACKETS ARE NOT PROJECTS!! I learned absolutely nothing and for the gifted class, thats pretty sad."
4878,Speech is considered a second study hall. If you want an easy A take the class. Every 3 weeks you stand in front of the class and talk to 2 minutes and thats all you do!
4935,"Hard, only because IB Anthro was disorganized...and a waste of time. Same material could have been learned in 1 month, not 1 YEAR!!! Bad teacher: avoid Anthro"
4992,"All she does is talk English..last time I checked it's supposed to be a Spanish class. Has absolutely no control over the class, ignores half the class and gets upset easily."
5048,Not a very good AP teacher. Lots of busy work. AP feels like regular class. Assumes students not taking AP. Gossips to students and doesn't teach very well.
5105,"Work is mostly just busy work. One could probably stay after with her, but one wouldn't want to. She also contradicted many of the things we were taught previously or learned afterwords."
5162,"Ok I don't get how people say he's a good teacher. I wasted my entire 7th grade doing aquaponics. I literally didn't learn anything. All we did was help him grow the plants and test the pH levels. This was everyday. I get it if he wants to teach us what pH is and how we can measure it, but there is no reason for us to do it EVERY SINGLE DAY. Plus, after our school year ended, all the plants died over the summer and so all the work we did the entire school year went to waste over one summer."
5219,"He is very nice, and i love the enviroment as much as he does, but it seems like more of a free time class than teaching...my friends know way more in their science classes than i ever do!"
5275,Never really has a lesson plan and we do the same thing every day. All she does every day is take attendance and thats the most effort she puts into her classes.
5332,These people who are giving her good rating know nothing. She is a terrible teacher. Her class was nothing but busy work and she was not an easy grader. I had a 98 in her class so I'm not saying this because I had a bad grade. I hated her class and did not mature as a writer at all. AP English was easier than her class and I actually got better at writing.
5389,"Whats with all the busy work? She waste to much time on things we didnt need to know, and we had worthless projects!"
5446,"Extremely difficult teacher to please. Just when you think you grasp what she wants, she changes the rules. Nothing is ever good enough. Hopkins delights in making it difficult to succeed. English used to be my favorite subject. I had taken AP English classes before and never had anything less than a B . I have had a D in her class all year. LA-AP with Hopkins is definitely not worth it. It took the joy out of my senior year. Her personality is flat line. Talks in monotone. Shows no emotion."
5502,"Ms. Bielak is the second worst English teacher I have ever had, and that's saying a lot. Very often she will go into philosophical rants over subjects that have nothing to do with the matter at hand, and that make absolutely no sense. Never try to ask her questions because more than half the time she doesn't answer anything. Our days are filled with Chrome Books and almost nothing else. Shelly does not engage her students unless she is forced to do so. Freshman beware."
5559,"Very unorganized, and REALLY ditzy.. and DEF. picks favorites. Obessesed over all honors classes and constantly compares regular to them."
5616,"Gotta love how she teaches one thing, and quizes us on another. Also, taking four hundred pages worth of notes on a food product is just wrong."
5673,"Miss Welty did nothing but sit on her computer,go across the hall, or go to the bathroom..u basically dodnt learn anything in History..it was fun @ times though"
5673,"Miss Welty did nothing but sit on her computer,go across the hall, or go to the bathroom..u basically dodnt learn anything in History..it was fun @ times though"
5786,"such a cool guy, and serves really great causes! but, i learned absolutely nothing...the teaching is really quick and bunched up in the last 15 or 20 minutes of class."
5899,She does not repeat herself in English when no one ever learned what she said. She's the reason I'm taking Italian next year.
6013,she teaches world today which is by far the worst class ever she also makes the class boring it was a waste of a trimester i didnt learn nothing
6126,whenever someone does somthing wrong speech and wastes are whole gym class sometimes the speech is about we are wasting our time when she's wasting it
6240,"Really nice and cool person, horrific teacher. Nothing will make me forget about the hell hole of Honors American Studies 1 with Jolicoeur."
6353,"Great guy, knows his physics. But cannot teach! Be prepared to study on your own. Two years (reg & AP) and I couldnt tell you much about physics, and I was one of the few who actually tried!"
6467,"She still hasn't graded my tests from freshman year. I'm a senior now! Also, she never actually shows up for class so if you like free periods, switch to her class. I never knew that I would get bored of free periods but with her, I did."
6580,I had her for study hall. She is very rude. I showed up for study hall a half an hour late every class. She only noticed once by the end of the year. She wanted to write me up.
6694,"won't ever help you, sometimes is a good teacher, but i dread everyday of having to go to her class...can you spell B-O-R-I-N-G!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
6807,i think he is a nice person but not a good chem teacher he tries but it doesnt work and he lets ppl do whatever they want in the class and tried to teach over the talkin i learned nothing in his class
6921,"worst excuse for a teacher ever, GOod intenitns that do NO good. I learned nothing besides to lie in his class when neccisary"
7034,One of the more does nothing or almost nothing teachers on campus. You can count the times he gets out of his throne. The average rating speaks for itself.
7147,period a 02 03...my god what a waste of a class...all i did was sit and laugh and wonder how she could possibly have not been fired...i learned nothing
7261,The tests are nothing liked we learned in class last year. I think she just copied them from somewhere and didn't care whether she taught us the material or not.
7374,"This teacher is lazy and will fail you. She does not explain math well and then blames it on the ""lazy"" class. She spends more time on her phone that actually teaching the class. I would not recommend anyone taking this class if you want learn math and go to college."
7488,"While she's nice... her class has no structure, and I failed all the tests and someone got an A? Learned nothing..."
7601,we were the most behind class in the 7th grade i hated it so much i didnt learn anything! you stink at teaching! I wan so behind in 8th grade! >:(
7715,"I have never had a worse teacher in my life, and I've had some pretty atrocious spanish teachers. I basically used her class as a study hall. If you want to ever have a chance at becoming fluent in Spanish I could recommend eating at taco bell more than I could recommend taking her class."
7828,um unless you wanna be in AP gym for a marking period i suggest you get the hell out of his class......
7942,"Compared to the gym teachers at Polson, Mr.B was AWESOME! At Brown, you don't have to do anything to get an A in gym (the way it should be). Unfortunately, it gets harder at Polson, so enjoy the easy gym classes while you can!"
8055,"She seems like a decent and fun teacher, but she wastes all of the class time doing useless things. She is very biased and picks weird random things to discuss this year. I wish I had we did more useful activities in class. She tries to imitate us and sometimes is rude to my classmates."
8169,"Very nice woman, but a terrible teacher. Actually, doesn't teach at all. Hands out worksheets then runs for the hills. No teaching is done in this class. Once in a blue moon, she will lead a class discussion, but other than that, she does nothing. Takes months if not an entire semester to enter assignments, papers, etc. We wrote a paper at the very start of the year, and we got it passed back to us at the beginning of second semester, therefore we had no time to correct our mistakes."
8282,"Powers is an absolutely ridiculous person who teaches an absolutely ridiculous AP Gov class. He made us memorize 100 court cases for a text, half of which my friend's father with a law degree had neve"
8396,Teaches fourth grade standards in high school honors classes. Could really use some classes on differentiation of instruction.
8509,she shouldn't be teacing a hih school class! WE hav NOT learned anything from her and i hate being n her class! everyoe does!
8622,"I hate her class, the assignments are completely irrelevant, and I have regressed as a writer because of her class. Good luck if you have her!"
8736,"My daughter literally did not learn anything in his class in two years, playing the same music as she did in elementary school--Partly because he allowed kids in the class that never played before."
8849,"Wantz is a terrible teacher. Her blind obsession with awards is almost funny considering how unskilled and incompetent she is. She turned journalism, which used to be a creative release, into one of my most dreaded classes. Gave students a 70% average on their first assignment for an ELECTIVE class. Please go ruin a different publication."
8963,"Ms. Cho makes poor use of the class time and focuses on irrelevant details. It is more important to her that we learn the definitions of vocabulary words rather than the actual history. I have learned all of my history this year from my textbook readings and in class she just repeats what I had read from the previous night. Yet, when I get to the test I see many things that we never went over. I have learned nothing in her class so far this year and she is inflexible in her teaching style."
9076,"Mr. McCloud acts like a nine year old; giving us ""free time"" which he uses to check Clash of Clans, and other useless games. Personally I don't learn anything in this class, because I took 6th grade spanish at another school and was taught by a normal adult teacher. Mr. McCloud is teaching the Mount Vernon Presbyterian 8th grade, 4th grade spanish. The only thing I learned in the class so far was that he gives people candy if they have seen the same movie as him. Literally the most useless class"
9190,great theater teacher but hardly cares about her english class. She will lose papers and she will blame YOU for it!
9303,I didn't enjoy having her as a teacher she was a good person but she doesn't know how to teach a class. She assigned to much busy work that didn't improve our learning experience at all.
9417,"Mr. Camacho was my History teacher who was supposed to teach our class in spanish because I'm in the dual language program. He ended up giving us articles in Spanish the whole year that we had to annotate, answer 3-4 questions, write a summary, and vocabulary. Many times the class didn't understand and were no able to receive help from Mr. Camacho. When he wanted to give us tests he gave them to us in English because he was too lazy to translate it into Spanish. I learned nothing in his class!"
9530,its obvious that he does everything possible to take up class time.. while lecturing he stopped and asked each of the 20 something students what their favorite book was.. obviously relevant
9644,"I had Mr. Kozak last year unfortunately. Mr. Kozak takes his studio art class too seriously for what it is. I am going to be accepted into no colleges because of him. It is a studio art class, it is NOT an AP course, which he takes it as. He gives grades for participation, but he asks approximately 2 questions and expects the whole class to answer. I once answered every single question he asked and I still got a grade that dropped my overall average. He gets me so infuriated."
9757,"Good teachers do not yell and scream at her students and assign busy work - lots of coloring.
If your child does not like coloring; opt out of her class asap.
Lots of valuable study time wasted due to"
9871,"She's nice, but not a good teacher. It seemed she spent more time putting her outfits together than organizing the class and assignments. I can't remember when she actually taught the class. Asking her questions is a waste of time because you get a very vague and generally unhelpful answer. Would not recommend."
9984,Never puts in grades and gets mad at me sleeping during her class when she doesn't even put any sense of effort into a good lecture/lesson/anything for spanish 5 AP. She always seems unprepared and ca
10097,"Had her class for about a few weeks and almost went insane. She is far from the greatest Spanish teacher at the school. Just hope you dont get her class, and if you do, try to get La Rhonda Ventura instead. Just try to keep away from her."
10211,"Mrs. Cooper is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She does not teach in class but tells you to go online or to come after school. Maybe I am confused, but isn't the class time for teaching!"
10324,She is the worst English teacher I have had through all four years of high school. She can't command control of the class and her tests are absolutely nothing like what she tells us they are going to
10438,"I've never wanted to die more than ever with him being my teacher. I'm in several AP/AICE classes and have had A's in all of them, however, with me being in his Chemistry Honors class, I have barely had a C. I've never been so over joyed for getting a D on a test before in my life. If you get him, I have one piece of advice for you. You should laminate your homework and notes so the tears just roll off."
10551,"wurst class ever. i got marked down on my decade assignment because i had ""too much information"".Too much info? Hows that possible. Sorry kc, didnt no u want a quarter of a page instead of a half."
10665,"He always gave extra credit for doing absolutely nothing, and was fired for having an objectionable search history."
10778,"Yep, he was ridiculously funny! But the material was about as clear as mud. He's not a teacher, he's an in-class comedian. Since most people don't go to his class to learn, they don't have a problem. If you are there because you want to learn, and not just the surface stuff, seriously consider asking for another teacher. I didn't learn anything in this class. He hates questions about the material. How can you be a TEACHER and hate QUESTIONS? However, I HAVE heard that he's improved slightly recently."
10892,I have taken Spanish for three years and loved the subject and this woman made me never want to never utter a single word of Spanish ever again. I have had some bad teachers in the past but at least they were not as much of a horrible human being as her. She honestly hates children. I am a straight A student who struggled through her class because she taught us nothing. I think she actually liked assigning things for the sole purpose of lowering everyone's grade. No person I've met likes her.
11005,"Mr. Caruso was my least favorite teacher in middle school. He is was so so so so annoying. He acted like this nice guy but was actually so rude to people in my class. All he ever did was yell at us for not raising our hand every single time he asked a question, talk about his books, or tell some useless story. I talked to people in other classes in it seemed that he rehearsed everything he would say in every class and say the same thing over and over. Awful teacher don't recommend."
11119,"I had Mrs. Hames over 10 years ago. At open house, parents asked her why most of the class had ""D's"" and ""F""s"". Her response was ""That's what they earned."" She will not help you at all.
