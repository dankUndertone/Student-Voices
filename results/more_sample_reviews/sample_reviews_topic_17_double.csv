20,She doesn't seem to be doing her job. I still don't have my attendence fixed and it's been many months now.
40,It is sad when a well respected educational institution is forced to continue to employ personnel of such low quality purely in the name of tenure. Hoffman is a shining example of the failures of the tenure system and a true detriment to the Â“excellence
60,She is incapable of separating feelings from work. The worst moments of my time in high school have been because of her.
80,"After I was accepted to M.I.T., Mrs. Couthard suggested that I go to New River for a year to ""get some requirements out of the way."" A veritable fountain of worthless advice."
100,"She is very unhelpful and should be eradicated from her current position at san diego high, she has repeatedly changed the complex rules and regulations to her own liking and had not been very beneficial to the successes of any department in regards to extra-curriculars."
120,"Unsure if she is still teaching. Would be surprised! Hopefully, she is no longer working with children."
140,"Worst instructor in this world existing
highest grade in midterm was 92 / 100 for an engineer with us
2nd highest was 54 !!!! he deal with students as if they are engineers and professionals
personally i knew that this instructor passed through horrible experience in the past and he is revenging >>>"
161,"Mrs Keen, I had back in 1995. I have left high school, graduated college and am now currently a sixth grade teacher.I cannot describe how unmotivating and grouc"
181,"If this guy was awarded a teaching certificate, then I suppose Arnold Schwarzennegar should be governor of California"
201,"As a former student of hers who is now studying at an Ivy League school, I can honestly say that her teaching has made me a successful college writer."
221,"can easily cross the line, hers is unfortunately a compulsory busy work heavy course. I don't care about Desperate Housewives!!!"
241,"Kenneth Crook is a teacher NOT a professor according to my research so far.
No teaching credentials found....this worries me.
UVU students need degrees to excel in the workplace but UVU hires it's teaching staff based on experience only?"
261,This instructor assigned more busy work then my other three classes combined. Anytime I tried to get help or clarity the responses was delayed by days. Her responses were very abrupt and without tact. She was not approachable what so ever. She acted as thought she could not be bothered. She appears to go to great length to critique and discredits your answers. Worst instructor experience ever! She seems very detached and shouldn't be a teacher.
281,I had high hopes when she came and I've been continually dissapointed. She is unprofessional and leads with fear. She's not the leader she needs to be and the school is sufferning.
301,"Man, did I ever hate this class and its grungy kitchen! It's new now, but it won't take much neglect to get to its former state."
322,"I had him in '94-'95, and in 4 years of HS and 4 years of college, one of the WORST teachers I've ever experienced"
342,The worst mistake WEston Public Schools ever made was over-promoting her. The schools have gone downhills since she took over. She is not professional or intelligent enough to handle the community and garners no respect from students or parents. The standard has dropped because she hires terrible admins
362,i cant believe that the district appointed such a nieve woman to direct a high school. even the dumbest students are smarter than her.
382,Should be a coach not a principal! He pales significantly in comparison to the previous principal who created such an excellent community at Oakton High School. Many good teachers have left because
402,"Why must you continue to believe that your libralism is so much better than any other political or moral belief? Public schools banned True/False for a reason, Brother."
422,"I am not sure how Tammy Dodson spends her time, but it doesn't appear to be at the school. She is out more days than she is in. But that is not the problem. The problem is her lack of basic knowledge. I don't know how she is in a crisis because we've haven't had to deal with that, but when it comes to schedule repairs and college searches, she is worse than worthless."
442,Not a spectacular counselor. Did not help me at all with scholarships or colleges for my field. Only referred me to somewhere else.
462,She made so many mistakes in class that it led me to question whether or not she really IS a qualified professional.
483,"I was not prepared for the final exam, my peers in other classrooms were much farther ahead and ultimately, learned much more than I did."
503,He calls himself a guidance director...i could get more guidance from a rock. Seriously i was in there for scheuduling and the only thing i heard was how his grandson was in U of M
523,"If she thought she was as smart as she thinks she is she'd be great. Apparently, she comes from a long line of exceptional educators. Wow, if she does and if they are any reflection on her teaching and education ability we are in trouble!"
543,SHE HAS HER FAVORITES AS WELL AS HER FOES AND UNFORTUNITLY I FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. BUT THE FEELING IS MUTUAL!!!!
563,NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON STAFFING IN THE WEAK AREAS. Continue to eliminate weak teachers and stress academics not gimics.
583,"stormking should be played at a competition, NOT at a graduation! what happened to pomp and circumstance ?!"
603,"I think Ms. Baxter has every intention of helping but is too overwhelmed with her different positions at school, that she forgets that she has offered help in the first place."
623,never follows through with what he says. He is responsible for so many of the upperclassmen dropping out of band. The music has become easier than we played in Middle School. He wastes our time!
644,"Average to less than average. Clearly the kids don't like her at all. They say she is daft and inexperienced, but I like her jokes."
664,"I agree with that last rating! I am not a wrestler, just an ordinary guy with a B average, and I am nonexistent to her!"
684,"Was very disappointed with his teaching. Our student quickly became disinterested and is simply going through the motions until graduation. Has the potential to be an amazing teacher, but still has a long way to go."
704,tenure was a mistake because of her. wanted negative numbers for the ratings. she doesnt clarify or help @ all. nd i have her TWO YEARS!!
724,"he really should be teaching high school, not 7th. ive been degrated since i walked into that room and have been since."
744,"Reflecting on FHS several years later, she was one of the worst instructors- condescending and unforutnately didnt facilitate the learning process at all."
764,Our family was expecting a unique approach to learning. We are finding this experience to be unsatisfactory in many of the critical learning areas.
784,she is the most unfair woman i have ever met.i do not understand how st.mark's continues to allow her to teach there.
805,"she asked us where the auditorium was in the high school. she has worked there for, oh about 20 years. is she kidding?"
825,Mr. Gibson is an absolute lazy person who does not help you at all when needing help and always follows what the department it doing. If his name appears on your schedule go directly to the administration to have it changed
845,"Very unorganized and not the best person to be placing college decisions with. She is a nice lady, but in terms of being on top of the college process she is not the best."
865,"Considering the fact that most of the class dislikes her, I would say that my rating is reasonable. Perhaps if she does not come to class 10-20 minutes late everday, the ratings will change."
885,"Mr. Finken, retired in Iowa as a middle school principal, and is often absent or leaving early from his responsibilities from his job. He currently lives in Iowa and has never been a part of the community, let alone our state. He fools some by saying he has a room at Hotel Wilber, or more recently an apartment in Beatrice, but is never seen in those locations. This lack of integrity and work ethic by Mr. Finken has allowed Mr. Uher to run rampant. He has no more integrity than Mr. Uher!!!"
905,"Very disappointing, lacks good judgement and the skills it takes to be a leader. Over all ill equipped."
925,"One of the sweetest ladies I have ever met. However, she is incapable of controlling a classroom due to PTSD from an incident with a student a few years ago that resulted in her having a miscarriage. She also isn't very clear in her teaching and does not follow through on the promises about her class she makes at the beginning of the year. We didn't come close to having hw every day and I'm still waiting for the third instalment of ""Element Friday"". Lastly, this is not a ""college prep course"""
945,"Jason Simmons was horrendous as a Dean of Students. My children attended school within the Noblesville school district from Kindergarten to graduation. During that time, we received exceptional communication, guidance and assistance from all Noblesville schools... Until Jason Simmons entered our lives. He is unfit to work in education at any level."
966,"Doesn't turn in all college stuff in on time, have to constantly call and email for recommendations, and pushes state schools"
986,Considering the good ratings he is getting these days he must have tackled the demons he was wrestling with back in 1977. He was an unpleasant sort.
1006,She didn't contact me when I left messages for her and she never returned my emails. I feel that she doesn't make if very clear on how to get an A in her class. Very unclear!
1026,"Dr. Park is a decent guy but he doesn't fully understand the education laws he is supposed to enforce. When challenged, he will retaliate against the child. Would benefit from more training/experience."
1046,most boring class i ever took. i have difficulty understanding why she was awarded her teaching certificate. -CG
1066,"unprofessional.
when asked to write a college recommendation, he does not follow through. the day before it was due, he still had not completed it! unbelievable"
1086,I had her fresman year. My worst year ever. I did not like her. I am sorry for those of you who must suffer in the future.
1106,"Seriously, ""Conjunction, Junction"", ""The more things change, the more they stay the same"", ""I""VE GOT MY X-MAS LIGHTS HUNG"". Quotes from Colby...get out now!"
1127,Gives too much homework and is a total perfectionist. No real science only data tables and graphs. If you get her get a schedule change quick.
1147,"Horrible teacher. Definitely a contributing factor to why Forest Grove High School has the lowest graduation rate in Oregon. Completely insensitive to students, total disregard for the districts rules about grading. Is happy to single out students in front of their entire class for reasons that may or may not be within said students control. This woman should have her teachers license revolved and work in a federal detention center with criminals, not in a school with children."
1167,"While he claims that his aloofness in his teching style is to help us prepare for college, he must realize that we are NOT college students; we need direction!"
1187,"She shouldn't be teaching looking back on it. Doesn't really teach. Just shuffles through most stuff. Very boring and strict. Clearly favors athletes over all, to a point they will receive higher grad"
1207,Mr. Board is very disorganized and routinely produces incomplete labs without full sets of results. Students are forced to guess and infer what should happen instead of viewing the actual results.
1227,where do i begin i suggest anyone that would like to come to this school should really consider their options because guess what science is the most horrible subject in that school ms hernandez awful
1247,"i DID graduate three years ago, so perhaps things have changed, but mr. wagner did not teach at all...he was a facilitator. great guy, but what did i learn?"
1267,"If you somehow happen to get Bramlett for a teacher, apply for a transfer out immediately. It is indeed true that you get stupider from being in her class."
1288,"worst guidance counselor ever... no help what-so-ever, only thing he did for me was to squash my dreams of going to the college of my choice... told me I wasnÂ´t good enought."
1308,"I am currently the mother one of her students and coincidentally a former Spanish teacher. From what I understand, her methods are mundane, do not elicit class participation, provide no opportunities for functional communication and are downright tedious and boring. I am surprised and saddened that a school such as Yorktown would tolerate such mediocrity. Quality language teaching should be dynamic, interactive, unpredictable and applicable--elements that appear to be totally missing from her classes."
1328,"pretty much a total tool. shes nice and all but thats because shes a ""yes man""...who knows what sides she on. probably the administration because they're the ones paying her 100k salary. this is what public school has become"
1348,"I want to apologize for my disrespectful comment, which I have taken down. I was caught on the moment and spurred on by piers. I hope you take no offense to them, but i will not change my rating. I feel in class you have given up on us since it's your last year., but this has been going on for two years. I also believe you do not have adequate control over your class, allowing them to boss you around. And lastly you don't us; you either turn on a video or hand our textbooks and say do it."
1368,"Very disappointed to play ball under this man. When I arrived at Broadneck my Junior year, I was already being prepped as a potential D-1 recruit yet due to his own personal beliefs associated with my life outside of Broadneck, he did not provide me playing time, justification or opportunity. This man was detrimental to my success on the field therefore will continue to hold a negative outlook on his true colors. I therefore quit a game I loved in my senior year!"
1388,"Mrs Halpern's postcard ""class participation"" system is very unfair. She also says a lot of things that are false and tests us on imformation she did not teach."
1408,Well I saw our iStep scores today and Chesterton rates at the bottom of all the High Schools in Porter Co. (only Portage is lower). If I could change schools I'd go to Valpo.
1428,"Worst coaching experience of my life. His loud, pointless yelling, the ineffective nature of his old-school drills, and his inability to relate or understand his players made my basketball season one of the most discouraging and disenheartening times in my life. Incidentally, the focus he had on his daughter caused the rest of us to lose confidence in ourselves and each other, which has extended into long after the season ended. I would not recommend his coaching ""experience"" to anyone."
1449,"Mr. Perone always has been, is a hypocritical, self-glorifier. So, the world has already been saved? Not until people like you are stopped..."
1469,He keeps messing up my classes. Didnt know which classes were available for me to take. My parents had to see the principal to straighten my program out.
1489,A bumbling bungler of a man. The mere mention of his name produces chuckles from the students for a reason.
1509,"ok well...DON'T TAKE HIGH MATH!! the low math class don't get nearly as much hw and she likes us better. At least she's retirerd (or ""graduated"") so no one else can suffer...."
1529,"Doesn't understand how the school system works. Bad at teaching. Unconsiderate... Easy course, though."
1549,"What a self-important person...all she does the whole first semester is babysit students working on a typing program, and watses an exorbinant amount of time."
1569,Hated her. Bitter? Yes. Clarity? I've had much better by far. To never see her again made graduation all the more satisfying.
1589,"She was the most horrible counselor on campus. Discourages you, tells you lies about how you can't get into college, and when you do wants credit for it."
1610,Mrs. Christen has done nothing what so ever to help this school. She is ruining franklin as we know it. I feel sorry for the next generation.
