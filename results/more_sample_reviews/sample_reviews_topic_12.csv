196,He was so abnoxious! I got an A in the class but thats only because of Ms. B! She should be conducting NOT him! He never let us out of class on time!
294,mrs northrup is very unorganized she messed up my grade and my friends gave me a detention for being tardy when shes tardy in the morning and everyone waits outside her class room for 5-10min
392,she is so negative. Every day we just enter the classroom and she starts yelling st us. I wish we had MRs. Hutteman.
490,"She was pretty much awful the entire year. as soon as i left her math class i was extatic, and when i walked in her room one day i forgot everything. thanks to ms.emanuel i got a 600 o my math SOL"
588,"SHE'S HARD, SHE'S A BAD TEACHER... AND EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO HER EVERY ADVISORY FOR HELP... I STILL FAILED THE CLASS..."
686,"WAS GIVING MY GOOD GRADES TO ANOTHER STUDENT THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER. WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT IT,SHE GOT MAD AND SAID IT WAS MY FAULT,CUZ OF OUR ALIKE LAST NAME"
784,"I am a sophmore at SRHS now and i can finally get away from this guy. He subbed for about a month in 8th grade, and everyone in the class bombed the test. It almost kept me from getting to go on the ECT.PS: He has sweaty armpits"
882,I hated her! I had her for homeroom and she wouldn't let us leave during STAR for anything not even the bathroom! She found out who my friends boy friend was and always bugged her about him!

1372,"september 23rd, 20,000. the year was 20,000 for a whole week. we WATCHED her write it... oh and i skipped her class 19 times freshman year and got caught once. by the sub."
1471,wow....what an interesting woman. she needs to retire...FAST. its was semester and she still didn't know people's names. she could never remembered what she taught us
1569,we watched a movie the last day of school when all the other global language classes didnt have to come so we walked out and he wrote us up. thanks a lot pajor
1667,WORST TEACHER EVER!I had 90s in math EVEry yEAr this year i fail midterm and he REFUSED to go over it then kicked me out into the hall when i asked why..if u get him GET OUT NOW!!!
1765,"I had Ms. Bobeck last year and I didn't learn a thing. I failed the last four tests and still got an A in the class, ha what a great teacher! *rolls eyes*"
1863,Chapman was horrible. i missed one hw and she called my parents and told them lies about me. she hated me and favored all the brainiacs in the class. no help
1961,Really confusing if you don't have friends in your class. Never knew what was going on for the first half of the year.
2059,I took 3 years of french in high school and my last year i had mr. teahan. I am now in french 101 in college and i still am having a hard time because i forgot everything thanks to this class. Horrible class.
2157,"SWITCH OUT NOW. I asked for help every single time I needed it but was denied. Finally, when the whole class insisted, she was very unclear and difficult."
2255,"She is an awful woman. My son comes home upset everyday, and he finally told me why. He said it was MS.backes. I didn't think it was anything big, so I left it alone. About a week later he called me and told me that she screamed at him, and that he had to file a BULLY REPORT on her. I talked to him and he didn't want me to email HER because he said she would send him to the principles office, like she did to another child. I talked to the school and they said they would talk to her, but..."
2353,"This year she had eye surgery so everyones feeling bad for her when she comes in and all she does in complain again. I cant stand her anymore, if you get her instead of mayercheck in 7th, get switched"
2451,i just have her for homeroom but she does unnessesary things like yelling at you three times even when you do nothing wrong
2549,Thanks for the 52 on the lab mrs. copeland. Ill try to remeber the half-life of popcorn kernals next time
2647,"Has never helped me, forgets my name, and doesn't teach. My spanish has gone downhill since he became my teacher. Thanks, Mr. Moreau"
2745,"Brannum was the hardest teacher i had over 4 yrs at TC, i took bio without honors and i still i rececived the lowest grade i ve had in all 4 yrs. for my 10th to 11th grade, i had all A s in everything. Everyone told me to switch to Fick and i thought everyone who said that just can't work hard enough, but i ended up with a low grade even though i tried."
2844,"She has a bad personality. she is ok,now that it is the end of the year. But in the bigging. She never teaches anything she is not helpful. Now She is moving to 8 Grade I better not HAVE HER AGAIN."
2942,I aced every assignment and test. I missed two hours of class. He gave me a B- because I wouldn't stay after my graduation four an extra four hours.
3040,I had the worst time in her class! She isn't leniant at all to anything even excused medical abcenses. If you begin to fall behind she has no way to recover notes and just recommends that you drop the class! I believe I would have understood algebra 2 better if I had a teacher willing to work with me from the start of the year.
3138,"She is sometimes good, and extremely easy. She doesn't grade that way though. I never got a 4. Also, the 8th Grade DVD. What a joke!!!!!!! You'll never recieve it. Sorry little kids!!!"
3236,One of the other teachers in the school told me not to listin to what Mrs. I said because she was probably wrong. I have to agree with the teacher who told me this. Sorry Mrs. I but your better at 3rd
3334,You know that when 7 out of 11 students fail a class there is something wrong. The students ended up trying to teach each other becaus eshe was never there.
3432,She is mean and at 1st she was allright but now we aren't even allowed to talk in advisory but she is only a sub but this could be permenent!:(
3530,"she is the worst teacher i have ever had,because when my friend was talking, she told ME to be quiet, and then my friend confessed that she was the one talking, and camille barre told her that she didn't care. So i got in trouble."
3628,she gave tests very frequently on information that was scarcely taught in class and criticized us on homework that we had no clue on how to complete and frequently sent people out into the hall for no reason and when they didn't know what we learned in class they had to continuously go into the hall until they were so far behind that they were kept after school until they were caught up and then the cycle repeated
3726,he gave everyone 100 extra bonus points on a test if they rode the bus. he gave someone detention for saying bye class when he was going to the bathroom. hes so annoying.
3824,you can get along with him if you are on the football team.he said I disrupted class even tho he & the jocks talked while I was doing my work.
3922,"he's super nice...but doesn't do his job well and messes up a lot of schedules. I got 2 messed up schedules from him, then met with Devries who easily fixed my problems and got it all worked out."
