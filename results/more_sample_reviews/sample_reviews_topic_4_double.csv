78,Lobdell is a hard teacher. He teaches very badly and fast ! He doesn't explain the material very well.
157,Ms. Busa has to use a calculator for her lessons and that makes hard for us students to understand her.
236,"She has absolutely NO patience. She rushes through all the materials, and does not clarify anything to the students. Sometimes, she doesn't even know how to explain things."
315,shes terrible for extra help. in my class only the kids with tutors are doing well. basically if u have her ur screwed
394,"...I have had to help people in my class understand the most simple of things (and have had to get helped) because Mr. Miller makes everything simple impossible, and the hard...lets just not go there!"
472,I have her as a math focus teacher. She isn't really helpful when it comes time to explain things.
551,"Dr. Headly did not explain the material clearly, he easily loses his patience when asked to go over something they don't understand, and he does not make himself available for help outside of class."
630,Good teachers that know her stuff. But when it comes to teaching she is not good at all. She jumps around topics and is very confusing. She is also very strict and an immigrant.
709,Ms. Carlisle doesn't know anything. She gets mad for ridiculous reasons and doesn't explain anything.
788,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Everyone in class ends up trying to teach each other because she can't explain anything.
867,While lenient with homework - she considers copying from a projector teaching. She didn't help with the harder concepts at ALL.
945,he is an okay teacher...does not prepare you for anything though...and can be very difficult to understand at times.
1024,"Hate him all he does is laugh after everything he says, very unclear and expects class to fully understand all even though he doen't explain it well."
1103,Can't understand her at all. She messes up simple math quite often and is overall bad at teaching.
1182,"She stays after to ""help"" us, but she makes other students help us. Everyone doesn't get math. If they do, they ask smart people for answers"
1261,She can't keep her classes' attention long enough to make everyone understand and gets frusterated when nobody understands what she didn't teach.
1339,how did someone who can barely do math end up teaching haverford's most advanced math class? don't take BC!
1418,I could never understand if this teacher was all their.She seemed intelligent but I had my doubt's sometime's.Her class is hard and expects alot out of her students
1497,He's not good at teaching basic geometry... My son is failing because of this.
1576,"the explanations she gives are impossible to understand, and the exams don't make any sense.
Teachers need to understand their subject before trying to teaching it to students."
1655,"he is a good teacher over all, he got his point across but his teaching strategies didnt work for me and he goes way to fast."

1970,"Mrs.Rivera is not a very good teacher I haven't learned anything in her class she doesn't clearly explain everything and when she does explains she just reads. She makes us do work for future ""work"" thats she is supposed to teacher later but she never does"
2049,"Horrible at explaining, you ask her a question and she answers something completely different. Doesn't make sure everyone understands the material before moving on, and isn't thorough on anything."
2128,i have always understood math was always able to get good grades always A's an B's in math... wel that was untill i had her. unhelpful. doesnt explain anything.
2206,"Really struggle to understand this teacher, she means well but is not able to get ideas across, then gets angry and waves her hands a lot when no one understands."
2285,"If you have him,Good luck! His teaching skills are poor. He moves way too fast and he doesn't know how to explain anything. He can not do basic math in his head. If you go for extra help outside of class time he doesn't provide much help at all! If you're stuck with him, get help from Mr. Sherman or teach yourself with the book!!"
2364,"I really don't like her way of teaching. Her lessons are basically the formulas or whatever one could find by himself in the summary section of the textbook. Barely teaches us how to apply those formulas. Goes super fast. Spends too much time making students put the homework on the board and explain the questions by ourselves, which is not helpful to most of the other students. Her class is the reason for me to think that I dislike math for the first time."
2443,"He's really hard to understand, doesn't care much about how we do the problems on the HW and doesn't know when a student needs to be switched to another math class because they are exceling in his."
2522,"Not a good counselor, made everything (scheduling classes, college applications, scholarships)difficult, and never helpful with other problems;Often tried to limit students and have them underachieve"
2601,Completely out of reality doesn't explain everything doesn't stay on topic blames everything on the students
2679,He is rude and micromanages EVERYTHING. He makes things needlessly complicated and insists everything be his way
2758,she talks about stuff that is not even math or science and doesn't teach us anything and when she doesn i dont understand it.
2837,unless you're a math wiz and can self teach yourself math then great but other then that precalc honors was not pretty
2916,"Her class isnt hard but she acts like we are all geniuses and should know how to everything without being taught. She has tutoring but normally wont help yu, just have you hang pasta from the ceiling"
2995,"She doesn't explain what she wants. She glosses over everything and leaves it up to the students to understand what she wants. If you want to be bored and confused, take her!"
3073,"Marshall could be the worst teacher there is for Precalc. Doesn't explain the material well enough, no step by step when teaching problems, and doesn't care that the class isn't ready to be tested."
3152,"didnt understand anything. maybe its just the subject, but she didnt help or make my life any easier."
3231,Mr. Dake fails to help the students when asked and quizzes and test were extreamly hard becuase he did NOT.. expalin enough
3310,"Good person, clarity-clear as fog. Hard teacher to follow unless you go in for help, even then its a pitiful sight"
3389,Worst teacher I have ever had. She makes everything confusing and NEVER teaches.
3468,I just can't learn from her. She doesn't teach well at all! She's so cute and nice but her class is super hard unless you're good at chemistry -_________-
3546,She has voice that makes it hard to understand her. I did not really respond well to her teaching style.
3625,"She makes concepts already learned more complicated than it already is. This happens when she strays too far from the textbook- which she can't do. Also, her accent is very difficult to understand. Combined with her monotoned voice, she knocks half the class out. She also shows favoritism to those who do well, and show signs of disgust at those who are struggling because they can't understand her. Her reviews do not match the tests. She often rushes through before students even master concepts."
3704,"She knows close to no actual Geometry of any sort of knowledge of Math. She can't do simple math in her head, for examples 0-6, and she doesn't explain anything. I'm not writing this cause I have a bad grade, I have a A+ in the class cause I get my dad to help me cause she can't explain anything with her limited knowledge for the life of her. She is super strict on showing you work to the point that you are forced to write down math that you can do in your head (that she can't)."
3783,"He is not very good at explaining what we are supposed to do. He always confuses me, and he tends to scream at other students, which scares some of us. Most of us are afraid to ask him a question, or if we do. He does not exlpain it throughly."
3862,She is very difficult to understand. She is a very nice person but she should teach something else.She even refused to answer my question on something I didn't know because she already said it. She also has a hard time understanding why her students are doing so bad.
3941,"Really just a ""here's a worksheet, fill it out"" type of teacher. Even when she does try to explain something, she gets frustrated if you don't understand and moves on."

4256,Very bad never tries to help students- boring class bad books to many essays not enough education
4335,"Will not go down as one of my good teachers. From what I hear this year, not many people like her either. She teaches unclearly and expects us to understand right away. Not a good teacher."
4413,"Ms. Sundri, is a bad teacher. She go fast and is hard to understand. She is mean and takes points off for everything."
4492,"I haven't even been in her class a whole year, but it's already rough. I never get bad grades in science, but this year im struggling. The closest thing to teaching she does, is making us copy down notes she won't explain, and half the time she's goes so fast you cant even finish taking them. She tells us about something new on the test a day before we get it."
4571,"Just can't teach. her notes are useless! she doesn't have a great understanding of material herself, from what I gathered."
4650,she's reallt boring!!!! also she's asumes that everyone has taken some sort of alg2 before...so she never really explained anything
4729,She was the worst math teacher ever. She gets off topic soooo much! I did so bad in her class I got moved down in math.
4808,"She gets distracted very easily and doesn't hold the class's attention. Rarely understood people's questions and never fully explained all of the material. She's a nice person, but..."
4886,"a very sweet woman, but it's really difficult to understand her all of the time. i understand that she has difficulties, but it really limits her as a teacher."
4965,she barely teaches the subject. pretty much expected us to do everything on our own. Doesn't really explain stuff well. shows up late to school. One time she gave us a really hard test and then made us correct it ourselves. nice though i guess
5044,ms. adams you were a hard teacher and I am glad i am done with your class have fun trying to teach other students.
5123,"Easiest class ever, just get on her good side and have an accent. Plus, do you homework( it doesn't even have to be thorough, it can be gibberish)"
5202,"Not the ideal teacher. She is a very harsh grader and is very hypocritical. At times, she can be understanding- but that is a rare circumstance."
5280,she is the worst teacher i have ever had. she doesnt explain ANYTHING and is really annoying! she is so bad at teaching and explaining things! i get so confused when she talks!!!!
5359,"This guy has no buisness teaching Math. Very soft spoken, no control over class room and dosent explain Math at all."
5438,I hated having her. She never explained anything and she had favorites( The perfect kids......) She tried to hard too!
5517,"Mr. Veader is actually a reacher that I dont really like, and lets just leave it at that. He is not at ALL clear and does not explain things clearly at all. Overall: very bad teacher."
5596,"Decent teacher, but goes on long rants if you don't do your work. Blames students for not studying, even though she did not teach us the material. If you sit in the back of the class, her handwriting is hard to read cause its in""script."". Favors people who speak French well and who had the language previously. Knows material but cannot teach well and does not answer questions, when she does she gets mad at you for not knowing the material. She talks about random topics a lot if you change it."
5675,"mrs. taylor is a sweet lady but doesn't know how to control a class to save her life. also she can't comprehend and answer questions, OR teach any form of math."
5753,"I dont understand her, shes teaching geometry this year but shes originally a computer teacher....she has no right doing this to us, we need to LEARN geometry!!"
5832,good teacher hardness but is a good teacher but i had some difficulty...i had trouble with the assighments and lots of other stuff
5911,"I made the unfortunate mistake of taking Schippers courses twice. She never teaches or explains the material, just gives us labs and doesn't explain how to do the math or how they relate, and if you want a good grade, you have to learn the material outside of class. I'm taking the class to learn how to do it in class, not to go home and look it up for 3 hours. She was nice and all, just doesn't explain the material well enough."
5990,"It's obvious he knows a lot about math, but does not relay it to his students well at all. VERY biased towards any Milton baseball/basketball player."
6069,Doesn't really know anything about math.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
6147,she is not a very good teacher. she hardley trys to help you in class. she says you can come in after class and get help but she is still not that helpful. she piles on homework as if we are in colleg

6305,"Worst teacher I have ever had. Hates boys, doesn't teach. I taught myself everything this year. Tries to blame everything on the students when in actuality she doesnt teach us, but when she does she does one problem one time and expects you to understand the entire topic. Worst teacher ever i hope she gets fired. 0/10"
