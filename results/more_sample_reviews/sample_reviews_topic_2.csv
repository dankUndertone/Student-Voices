178,He puts stuff on tests that were never in our notes. I am wondering HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS. i wonder why everyone is failing his class...
357,Very easy class but don't expect to learn anything. Lots of busy work. May have difficulty on exams because she has not taught what is on it very well.
535,"Busse expects you to read the chapters he covers, but he won't tell you that. He doesn't teach you everything on the test. Read the book and you will pass his class. Inappropriate and funny. Good guy."
714,SHE DOES NOT TEACH! She expects us to know everything so we all fail our tests which has nothing on it that she fought us.
892,had her for frosh sci AND h. bio there is no way i will ever take any other class she teaches no matter what
1071,"She doesn't help anyone in my class learn and her lessons are repetitive and boring. In her class, we have never done anything except notes and tests."
1250,"i wish helen vendler was never even born, would have made this class a lot more tolerable. he doesn't prepare you adequately for the AP test and just gives you a lot of busy work. you have to prepare"
1428,"She ""taught' science, but didn't reallly know any phys sci (just some bio) and didn't care enuf to learn so she could teach us even tho that was part of the req. lessons."
1607,"easy class if you're self motivated, she teaches nothing; wait for Coach Tonn next year and he'll teach you what she fails in"
1785,"Is funny, but not a good teacher. Most students dont pass the AP exam or barely will. Doesn't give you enough information to actually pass the tests. SWITCH OUT."
1964,those who like her because she never teaches in the class; always off topic; I put on my headphone on for the whole cycle and she never noes; worst teach I had
2143,"Not a good teacher, doesn't teach you anything from what will be on tests"
2321,this teacher is not a good teacher. Everyone fails her class and tests.Even though she lets us re-tests she will make it harder and make people fail.She really needs to learn how to teach better. Thx
2500,"Honestly she never really ever teaches us anything. She is off topic lecturing about things we don't need and don't care about at all - on and on. She constantly gives us loads of homework everyday, which would make sense if she was teaching us the materials, but she only gives us textbook work. You really wouldn't learn if you didn't read the book. She also brings these awful magazine clippings almost every. She shows us things and lectures us on them when they have nothing to do with the class"
2678,"doesnt teach very well in class because she cant control her students, so make sure to try to learn the information on your own before tests, because if you fail a test your grade goes wayyy down."
2857,All she is about is MLA. She couldn't give a ____ about anything else. Her tests are about the things in a story that DONT matter. Her projects are poorly planned and the expectations aren't well layed out at all.
3036,"Please do not take that teacher. he is no help for his students, he doesn't give any study guides to help at tests, his exam are horrible it's like nothing you study are on the test. he's gonna tell you to buy the online guide don't buy he's making you waste your money, before the semester ends half of the class will drop. His final is from chapter 1 to 15 and he add to more chapters. He expect you to know everything on the book. If you one of the students that cannot study a lot DON'T TAKE HM."
3214,"Could be such a great class if it wasn't for all the notes she makes you do. She barely teaches and when she does, it's extremely insufficient for tests."
3393,"Probably one of the crappiest teachers I have ever had. He doesn't do anything, ever. He just gives us worksheets or other busy work while he just gets on the computer."
3571,"Her class is easy. But she DOESNT TEACH. At all, she writes on the board tells you to copy it. And her notes dont go with anything on the tests. TERRIBLE TEACHER."
3750,"The amount of crazy flowing through her brain is at such a huge amount at any time of the day. Not only does her whole entire lesson come from the textbook but you also get tested every week, and some weeks you can even get tested on every single day! This teacher is the reason im not taking spanish next year."
3928,"She is by far the worst teacher i've had, first of all she does not teach at all and her tests have nothing to do with what she teaches, she taught us an entire section that was half the final in 2 days. Although she is nice, you do not learn anything in that class."
4107,"scribbles a bunch of stuff across the board, which is not easy to copy down for studying, and then exects you to know the minutae of it on the test. bring a tapedeck to tape the class."
4286,i think mrs. pyle is a bad teacher. she doesn't teach us good lessons and we don't learn much. she expects us just to do the homework and then we will know everything. she should teach the class more and have more control over the classes. she makes it a difficult way of learning and i haven't learned much and failed the tests. i htink she hsould give us review sheets for the tests because most of her students in the class are failing the tests and they're hard without review sheets or good lessons!!
4464,"I took APES with him... it was a disaster. All we did was watch movies all year, then closer to the AP exam he deciders to rush and ""teach"" us all the stuff he missed. It's ridiculous. He is lazy and most classes i just sat there with nothing to do. He is a nice guy, but a terrible teacher. You have to teach yourself all of the information."
4643,"she doesn't prepare you for the Ap exam at all. Gives you months to finish an assignment. Didn't have any tests for the whole year, and she rarely gives out homework. You don't have to try to get an A in her class, but you'll fail the exam if you don't self study."
4821,She is one of the worst teachers my children have ever had. All she does is give notes and tests.
5000,He gives ridiculous homeowork assignments on stuff that we do not learn and he goes on and puts that stuff on the tests
5179,All we ever did in that class are labs. She just sits on her stool & goes on her computer. She hardly taught anything.
5357,She failed everyone on an exam worth 10% of our grade. Her lectures are unclear and nobody understand what is going on. She has good intentions but is not a good teacher. She sees everything very black and white and makes no acceptions. Her test have no realativity to what she lectures about so everyone fails them.
5536,"I had him last year as my statistics teacher. Very disorganized when it comes to notes and the class is a self study class. Essentially on the night before the test, you have to teach yourself and memorize things because he is terrible at explaining things. Terrible teacher"
5714,Mr. Stern did not teach my class very well and did not teach what was going to be on the test. He made me dislike science class and I love science.
5893,"I had her for geometry last year and she teaches you nothing. Everything I learned last year I had to teach myself. When you ask her for help she just makes you more confused. She puts stuff you never learned on the tests, and basically gives you the answers when you ask for help on them, even on the final."
6072,i hate it his class. he is not very helpful on test. if u do not know it then u screwed cause he will not help u.
6250,"Dr. Anderson is funny but he can not teach.
He is horrible at teaching. I don't learn anything in his class.
The only reason he came to Tech, was to coach the tennis team."
6429,"She is trash. Doesn't know anything about science and relies on worksheets to teach us. Also a lot of useless homework. If you have her, I pray for you."
6607,"she gives you a bunch of papers, and doesn't explain them. She expects you to know everything before she even ""teaches"" it. She yells at you for everything, and her test are impossible. taking her honors biology is like taking an AP biology class. Love Loui tho."
6786,"Doesn't teach, complains about people being insecure and complains all the time and gives quizzes over stuff she doesn't teach, and comes in high or with a hangover it seems."
6965,Would like to switch out of AP and take it with another teacher. He is not preparing us for the exam!
7143,Not GOOD! packets every day. Dont know when we have tests. Agenda for the day is from a students NB from last year.
