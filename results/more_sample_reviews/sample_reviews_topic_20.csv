16,Liberal. Enough said.. She pushes her thoughts and opinions on others by leading questions and bias information. Such a hypocrite.
33,"Amat loqui de sociali vita, quae aliquando inconveniens. Ludunt ludis omni tempore et non in fossis inveni eos. EGO sentio amo ego didici omnino nihil. Paenitet Mrs Hahn."
50,"Such a biased teacher, tries to brainwash student...Bread not bombs, shove that pin where the sun don't shine."
67,"Can be over opinionated, does not like.to be contradicted about opinions or if she is misinformed continues to insist only on her views."
83,Your the worst and most borining history teacher i have ever had and i love history. you have ruin this year for me.
100,"his emotional rants preclude any rational discourse. teaching should involve a healthy exchange of ideas, but if you disagree with him, you're belittled... even though he's wrong!"
117,"She is very opinionated and does not teach objectively. If you disagree with her, you will struggle in her class."
134,She was different than the other gym teachers. VERY different. Very colorful. i didn't think she was aware of the dress code at schoold either.
151,"i thought that when you teach art, you make people love it. she does the exact opposite. very uncreavtive and dull."
167,"I hated her class with a passion. Her opinion was the only one allowed in the classroom, and if you didn't agree with it, then you didn't matter."
184,"Dont touch her things, YOU'LL GET GERMS ON THEM! and if you dont want charcole on your silk shirts, then either change shirts or change prfessions! oh, and P.S. YOU NEED MORE DEMENTION!"
201,She presents a highly biased view of history. She should make her courses more balanced. They are too feminist and left-winged now. Take the challenge Ms. Fields!
218,"Ultimately adamant with his own form of teaching. Those who don't adapt to it well fail, period. Funny, but close-minded."
235,I believe she works us students to death on taks when taks is important yes but sat on the other hand is equally important she focuses way to much on taks.
251,"Has no idea that other religions even exist and he's a HISTORY teacher. Harassing. Demeaning. And serves no purpose other than to bring other christians down. Get in politics, get out of the school."
268,Do not fear alumni. She never gave me more than an 85 on anything and now I am a published writer! An 85 in her world = 100 in the REAL world!
285,"Has a socialistic political agenda that he tries to sneak into class, which would be fine if he owned up to it."
302,"too much hw n proj. too borin and slow. ""you have a ll the time in the world"" is just an expression!!!"
319,she is such a weird person. u dont get a good grade unless u share her opinion on things. a teacher is supposed to be open to other ideas.
335,"Does not appreciate greatness, or for that matter eccentricity. Does not understand History is diverse in its intepretation. Should read textbook, and you will be alright."
352,She made me feel like I wasn't good at art and she didn't appreciate my piece in fashion. didn't really value time we had in class
369,She doesn't accept any opinion but hers. Proving her wrong is impossible in her eyes. Not very fun or flexible with her units. SWITCH OUT NOW.
386,"She sux. she cant even pronounce terms right. Her information is biased, she forces her religious beliefs on students.Theres a reason 4 sparating church & state"
402,We R chapin... lets get real we have always been chapin and he is not going to change that.. where is a poem for that one??
419,"Very Stubborn women, has lots of favorites and likes only those who view the world she does. ITS ALWAYS HER WAY OR NO WAY AT ALL."
436,"WOW Mrs. Kissinger needs a chill pill. During Civil War studies, she made us shout ""Yes sir!"" when asked a question and gave us points for how loud we shouted."
453,"She is unfair, and doesnt stick to what she says. She bases her opinion of you on what others say. She is not a nice woman."
470,Biased. Can't make up her mind about her ideas. Seems to claim that other people are less open minded than her... not true. Not very smart.
486,"I agree with these negative reviews and then some. While other teachers read/teach classics, you get a choice in her class of Flight or The Red Tent, but it doesn't matter because no one reads the books anyway."
503,"worst teacher i have ever had by far. feminist who does not tolerate anyone else's views, and to get a good grade, you have to pretend to have the same political views. also very arbitrary"
520,She spends way too much time gosipin with people than teaching then expects us to pull this information out of thin air.....and get everythin right on the hw
537,"her class is too tough... she tells you that you just read whats on the top and to read what the ""underlying theme"" is, and then when you do, its ""too deep"""
554,"Her global studies class is an atrocity of the human spirit, it's the real global issue."
570,"TTM... twardy's tape mix. pumpin iron to mortal combat, and of course the classic... its raining men. 30 sec break. go!"
587,She has biast ideas on subjects in civics and teaches her own ideas. She had us watch all these news stations BUT FOX news which is the only conservative one.
604,he is way to closed minded and will put anyone down if they do not have the same beliefs as he does. judges everyone and is very unclear and always needs to be right. but deep down is a good person
621,WORST TEACHER EVER! she can take all of her 20 lb packets and her evil laughs and shove 'em......where the sun doesnt shine...
638,"I was one of the parents who she would actually allow to help out, and I can say not one good word about this woman's true character."
654,"I agree, what's with the lab coat? he even wore it for NHS when evry1 else had suits on... also, why didnt u go to nam? u got ""physically sick?"" yea right"
671,"I've never been in a class before where I haven't learned a single thing the entire year, but Euro with Mr. Witmer proved me wrong. He doesn't teach, skips important events in history (i.e. World War II and the Holocaust) and is extremely confusing."
