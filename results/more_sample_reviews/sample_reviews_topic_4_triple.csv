52,Terrible Teacher ! Teaches extremely fast and gets angry when a student can't keep up
105,"Her directions are VERY unclear, and she mumbles so you cant understand her, but then she gets mad at you for not understanding her."
157,Ms. Busa has to use a calculator for her lessons and that makes hard for us students to understand her.
210,"Does not explain anything, and is not helpful. Does not explain. Does not answer questions"
262,"he was really nice, but i doubt he even knows how to do math, he would never finish a problem when we needed help."
315,shes terrible for extra help. in my class only the kids with tutors are doing well. basically if u have her ur screwed
367,"Can't understand the guy, Don't understand what he's teaching (He cannot teach)and talks to much about growin up 2 b math teachers."
420,she cannot tech any of the subjects that she teaches and she won't help you if you come to her for extra help
472,I have her as a math focus teacher. She isn't really helpful when it comes time to explain things.
525,Nice. Not a consistant grader. Does not explain anything! She isn't very helpful or understanding. Expects honors students to know everything without explination or being taught.
578,"i never understand what shes trying to teach us, she goes very fast and it's hard to understand! I dont like it."
630,Good teachers that know her stuff. But when it comes to teaching she is not good at all. She jumps around topics and is very confusing. She is also very strict and an immigrant.
683,"She favors students that were in her honors class, and is no help when you are confused. She does not teach."
735,She has a difficult accent to understand. She makes lots of mistakes while teaching at the board. Her grammar is terrible.
788,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Everyone in class ends up trying to teach each other because she can't explain anything.
840,"Okay teacher, doesn't go over things all that well and can be unclear. He sometimes does random demonstrations that I don't know how they relate to the lesson, and doesn't exactly teach the lesson fully until the day after the homework is assigned."
893,"The worst teacher I've ever had. If you don't do it his way, he won't take the time to understand your way. If you can't do math fast- you can't do it at all."
945,he is an okay teacher...does not prepare you for anything though...and can be very difficult to understand at times.
998,hard time with the programming cuz she isnt teaching it at all. she expects us to get everything the first time. bad teacher.
1050,She never explains anything. She only wants students to explain it to the class. I need more out of a math teacher.
1103,Can't understand her at all. She messes up simple math quite often and is overall bad at teaching.
1156,"She is a really smart math teacher, but I she can't teach! She goes way to fast and springs tests/quizzes on us so fast! We don't know it 1/2 the time!!!"
1208,"one of the worst teachers i have ever had. she often makes many mistakes, harshly reprimends students for not understanding math. not a good teacher at all, I wouldnt recomend her dont take her class"
1261,She can't keep her classes' attention long enough to make everyone understand and gets frusterated when nobody understands what she didn't teach.
1313,a terrible teacher. concepts that were so hard to understand in her class were incredibly easy in algebra 2.
1366,"He is a bad teacher, and can NEVER explain anything well! Whenever he tries to clarify he makes too many mistakes which confuse everyone! It is a self-teach class, and a goof-off class :/"
1418,I could never understand if this teacher was all their.She seemed intelligent but I had my doubt's sometime's.Her class is hard and expects alot out of her students
1471,"Does NOT explain things well -- explains things rather vaguely; is sometimes impatient with those who ask questions. Good guy, but unclear."
1523,i had her for adv alg and dropped back to alg and had her again. I must say she is a much better alg teacher than Adv Alg. She is not very helpful though.
1576,"the explanations she gives are impossible to understand, and the exams don't make any sense.
Teachers need to understand their subject before trying to teaching it to students."
1628,"He is boring. He goes through all the lessons too fast, and sometimes doesn't explain something until after we grade it."
1681,"When a teacher tells the kids in the class who understand the material to teach the ones who don't, you know somethings wrong. She also goes lesson by lesson without even checking if we understand the things from the previous section."
1734,she isn't very helpful and is not a very good teacher for this subject. she doesn't listen very well to students and does not try to help them.
1786,"Nice guy, only calls on those who are struggling though. He rarely makes sense and seems to only teach what the class already understands"
1839,"I really don't find his style of teaching helpful. While he is nice enough, he moves really quickly and doesn't slow down. I can't write and listen at the same time! I wish he would explain more."
1891,"god, it's so difficult to understand this man. He can pronounce the words ""football"" and ""half"" bad wrestling coach too."
1944,"I was great at math with Ms. Kuberska, but BOTH times that I've had Mrs. Aboody, I've had to get a tutor."
1996,"She taught us a bunch of stuff that turned out to be untrue, her accent made her hard to understand, and she always blamed the kids for not understanding the material. Not a great experience."
2049,"Horrible at explaining, you ask her a question and she answers something completely different. Doesn't make sure everyone understands the material before moving on, and isn't thorough on anything."
2101,She just doesn't make anything clear. She teaches science and that is hard enough. That was my favorite subject until I had her last year!
2154,No one can understand her. And she goes super fast and isn't very helpful one on one. She pauses in the middle of sentences and she doesn't pronounce all the letters in words. Hard to understand accent .
2206,"Really struggle to understand this teacher, she means well but is not able to get ideas across, then gets angry and waves her hands a lot when no one understands."
2259,Is not good about explaining concepts. Better if you see her during student hours but unclear in class. Puts answer key up but does not go through problems.
2312,She was nice but she cannot teach the subject at all. She goes to fast or everyone and doesnt really teach it too your or explain it well until the day of the test which is pointlessBy far my worst math teacher
2364,"I really don't like her way of teaching. Her lessons are basically the formulas or whatever one could find by himself in the summary section of the textbook. Barely teaches us how to apply those formulas. Goes super fast. Spends too much time making students put the homework on the board and explain the questions by ourselves, which is not helpful to most of the other students. Her class is the reason for me to think that I dislike math for the first time."
2417,"I dislike Betsy, she makes test impossible, because she is the, ""most hardest teacher to understand."" My son cant understand even what she is trying to teach. He has to ask me everything."
2469,he truely tries to teach the class...but he just cant! he assumes that you are understanding everything he is teaching and when you go in for help...it doesnt really help just makes it worse!
2522,"Not a good counselor, made everything (scheduling classes, college applications, scholarships)difficult, and never helpful with other problems;Often tried to limit students and have them underachieve"
2574,"She doesn't really explain anything well and never really answers your questions, but she will probably get better at it with more experience."
2627,Not a fan. Makes English too difficult because he doesn't explain or help
2679,He is rude and micromanages EVERYTHING. He makes things needlessly complicated and insists everything be his way
2732,"Doesn't help students at all, and the smartest kids in the grade aren't doing well in her class"
2784,Didnt explain concepts well in class. Just gave homework and didnt teach the material or give notes about it. Very boring and unhelpful
2837,unless you're a math wiz and can self teach yourself math then great but other then that precalc honors was not pretty
2890,"she is an awesome teacher, she doesnt teach anything and just makes us read books. that doesnt work for most students, hate to tell ya ms. sanda"
2942,"Mr. Talbot is very unclear. He gived work out and doesnt really explain it. He is acool teacher to have, but his work is hard"
2995,"She doesn't explain what she wants. She glosses over everything and leaves it up to the students to understand what she wants. If you want to be bored and confused, take her!"
3047,"Not the best of teachers, especially in honors. The notes you take are the whole test, but she never explains them."
3100,"hes not good at getting potint across and he has a temper problem but if you go to him one on one hs a nice guy and he can be helpful, just not in class."
3152,"didnt understand anything. maybe its just the subject, but she didnt help or make my life any easier."
3205,"This is my first year having her as a teacher. I would NOT recommend you getting her class, if you do, I suggest you switch out. Although she may seem ""cool"", she does not really teach you anything except the basic concept you can read off the book. She does not explain well due to accent, which i d"
3257,"I had her freshman year and now senior year, and I still do not like her. She is difficult to work with and not understanding of problems at all. An incredibly hard grader, for no reason."
3310,"Good person, clarity-clear as fog. Hard teacher to follow unless you go in for help, even then its a pitiful sight"
3362,He only tries to make things easier for himself. He says that we should teach ourselves the material and doesnt bother thoroughly explaining anything relevant to the class.
3415,"pretty hard. never keeps on the subject, and doesnt have time for his students when they need help. he really picks favorites too...."
3468,I just can't learn from her. She doesn't teach well at all! She's so cute and nice but her class is super hard unless you're good at chemistry -_________-
3520,"She's alright. nice but kinda crazy. Had her for Geometry Honors. Bad at explaining, she explains the wrong things, everyone gets what she explains but no one knew what she didn't explain."
3573,Good luck if you get her. She makes everything so much more difficult than it has to be.
3625,"She makes concepts already learned more complicated than it already is. This happens when she strays too far from the textbook- which she can't do. Also, her accent is very difficult to understand. Combined with her monotoned voice, she knocks half the class out. She also shows favoritism to those who do well, and show signs of disgust at those who are struggling because they can't understand her. Her reviews do not match the tests. She often rushes through before students even master concepts."
3678,She definitely picks favorites and she goes extremely fast and the whole class gets confused and then she gets mad.
3730,"this geometry teacher doesn't know what she is doing, and i wish that she could speak more clearly. !HWPD!"
3783,"He is not very good at explaining what we are supposed to do. He always confuses me, and he tends to scream at other students, which scares some of us. Most of us are afraid to ask him a question, or if we do. He does not exlpain it throughly."
3835,she's not stupid; she knows her stuff but she isnt very good at explaining topics. the class is easy though i was in honors and she never even checked homework.
3888,"She doesn't teach. It's really difficult to achieve una buena nota in this clase, because you have to basically teach yourself. She also doesn't really explain the assignments."
3941,"Really just a ""here's a worksheet, fill it out"" type of teacher. Even when she does try to explain something, she gets frustrated if you don't understand and moves on."
3993,her grading sytem is wacked up. She usually spends half the day trying to figure out why she can't solve the probelms. She makes so many mistakes contradicitng herself it just screws with our head. Good luck with this teacher.
4046,"He's a fun guy, but a terrible math teacher. There are only 4 A's in my class for geometry. He talks fast and doesn't explain at all."
4098,"a good person but can't teach for her life, makes frequent mistakes and is not very clear. she should NOT be teaching honors"
4151,She never helps anyone in my class. When someone is confused she gets very angry. She has no tolerance for anything.
4203,"Awful, I'm pretty sure 75% of her students in trig/alg2 have a grade lower than 80, but she blames the students for the bad grades. She goes through things very quickly but if you ask her to elaborate she answers in one sentence and moves on. If you have her, get a tutor you're going to need one."
