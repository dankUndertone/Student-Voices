4361,Ms. Spector needs to be more considerate of her students as well as more repsectful.She needs to take the time to LISTEN to what they say.
4441,"spends absolutely no time teaching music. I don't know what he is, but chorus director isn't it. anything we learn we learn on our own. needs to put down his phone and tablet and maybe do his job."
4522,She is one of the worst Spanish teachers I have ever had. She doesn't even teach us and gives us the hardest test. She should also learn how to speak English before teach a class how to speak Spanish so we can understand her.
4603,she might be a bit better teaching college students. she doesn't seem to have the right patience for high school kids

5410,"even though i heard she quit teaching at bsba , i still shudder at the thought of her teaching english my 8th grade year... i do not remember her fondly to say the least"
5491,she is one of those teachers that wont teach you a thing and expect you to go out of your way to learn from videos online with mass amounts of homework better off just not even showing up.
5572,i think ms G is the most uneducated teacher i have ever had plus she is over her head trying to teach us how she does. she is way to unorganzied and cannot hold on to students work

6622,"He is immature, and does not know his boundaries. Yeah, sure, he was relaxed, and let us slack off, but he was inappropriate, and didn't take teaching seriously"
6703,at the beginning of the year we had 30 kids. at sememter we had 14. at the end of the year 5 kids were eligable to go to spanish 3. 2 of those kids already spoke spanish. hmmmmm...
6783,yea...well...mr. rodvelt is an ok teacher when you already know what your talking about but when its all new to you you just stay confused and he seems to not c

7106,Everything says doesnt make sense and he doesnt make anything clear. He's cool but he cant teach and misses so much class.
7187,She's okay but she takes everything too seriously even though her class is a joke. She needs to relax and enjoy life.
7268,"Does not teach anything. Very mean to the point the kids dont even want to go to her class. We need teachers who can work wit the kids. Not trying to be rule masters, She needs to go."
7349,"Truthfully, all I learned from this class is that I really wished I had Mrs. Hatchl instead. He just consulted her for everything and could barely do anything on his own."

7672,She is obviously not true to herself. She does not know how to teach well. She might come off to be very fake at times. She blames people for her problems.

8076,"I feel super sorry for you if you have him, bring a tent and some s'mores. You're better off teaching yourself rather than listening to him."
8076,"I feel super sorry for you if you have him, bring a tent and some s'mores. You're better off teaching yourself rather than listening to him."
8237,Nice lady but cant teach to save her life. Doesnt know the first thing about chemistry making it difficult to teach to honors students. Completely contradictary and who knows what clear as mud means?
8399,She is a bad teacher. She doesn't even teach anything she just expects us to know all of the work when we are supposed to learn it all this year. She gives too much homework and her grading is terrible.

9206,"She's a nice lady, but she absolutely cannot teach AP Spanish. I feel like I know LESS about Spanish than I did before I took her class. :("
9368,SOOOOO bad. She sets the WORST example for us. Are we to grow up to be ez? A child could teach a better lesson. She can't even spell!
9529,"I did not like her. She gets over-excited when she teaches. I think she could concentrate on making kids understand the material, instead of singing songs."
9691,I don't learn anything from her and lately she's been really mean to me. Don't ask why 'cause i don't know.
9852,I don't think Ms. Z likes us. She never lets us do anything that we suggested and it makes the class fight back. I think we need a new one.
10014,Mrs. Lewis needs to learn to give a due date. Also she needs to learn how to teach. If she is going to be super hard with grading she should say EXACTALLY what she is looking for!!
10175,"I havent learned anything all year in her class so far, its mostly just taking notes. I honestly dont think she knows her own subject well enough to be teaching it."

11467,SHE IS SO BAD. IN HER CLASS YOU MUST KNOW TO LEARN BY URSELF OUT OF THE BOOK. EVEN IF U TALK TO HER SHE IS NO HELP AT ALL
11629,"The only reason some of you like her is because she shows favoritism in her classes. Whoever said she doesn't ""teach how we want her to,"" she hardly takes the time to teach the students who need it."
11790,"She is very nice. And she gives ALOT of extra credit. But she doesn't know how to teach. She often leaves question partially answered and makes the students immensely confused. She is a terrible teacher for people who know english and are not fluent italian speakers.

13083,"Stofer is a really bad teacher. First, she doesnt know how to speak english. Second, she doesnt know how to solve a simple math problem. Lastly, she doesnt know how to teach. She never corrects your mistake so you dont know why you got it wrong. This is supposed to be a CP class and i dont know why she is making this class so hard."
13244,"I'd have to say he is really ignorant and he shouldn't be a teacher. Any student who keeps up with current events (as in watches the news) knows more about poli.sci,us his.,or law all he says is u kno"
13406,Had Bailey the 1st yr she taught Span and she didnt know a thing about the subject and yet she taught. The prinicpal made a mistake in hiring someone like her.

14213,"Mr. Swick isn't a teacher. He doesn't teach. He gives us music and expects us to teach ourselves. I could do the same program on my own by just downloading the sheet music myself. Plus, he's biased."
14375,Comment below is from Hersey Obv... She can't teach and is extremely strict if you get her get out now!!! If you say shes nice wait till after the 7 days of being able to switch classes is over.
14536,"I agree. Nice lady, but doesn't teach. Lies herself into believing that kids like to do the teaching. She just sits at the back of the room while we try to teac"
14698,I went into her class with four years of previous spanish classes and flunked because she can't teach. Horrible attitude towards children (she thought she was better than all of us).
14859,worst English teacher I have ever had. Makes you colorcode everything and godforbid she actually explains somethig one time instead of giving us bookpgs to read
15021,okay this lady is completly insane! it is becasue fo her i dropped orchestra. she needs to either get fired or quit. FACE!!!!!!!!!
15182,she chosses favorites and she dosent even how to prounounced spanish word right and she is a very boring teacher and you have to be in her good side because if you dont she can yell as loud as she can. And she makes everyone pay the consequences even tough you didnt you didnt do anything. SHE IS NOT A GOOD TEACHER!!!!!!!!!
15344,she should retire 'cus all she does is sit at her desk and read her emails or a book. she didn't teach me a thing

15667,"out of all the teachers i know, she is the worst one ever. she can't teach, her class is so boring, i feel like the being in her class is a waste of my time"
15828,"She's REALLY useless. She doesn't even know the material herself, has no clue about what she's doing, and her own code contains lots of syntax errors and is often broken in many places. I've seen many times where SHE WAS LITERALLY TRYING TO LEARN THE MATERIAL WHILE TEACHING (in the very few instances where she attempted to do that) IT TO US. Like seriously?!!?!? I'll be serious right now, I suspect she would have gotten no higher than a 3 on the AP exam should she decide to actually take it."
15990,"she is horrible... can not teach at all! she tries to act like shes so nice but she is so mean. whenever you ask her a question about what word means what, she tells you to look it up in the spanish dictionary. she is ridiculous especially for oral tests. she mumbles and you can not hear her at all, you tell her to speak up a little and she still mumbles, so you get a bad grade on it because you cant hear her unless you have super ears or something"
