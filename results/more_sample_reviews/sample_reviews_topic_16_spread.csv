Comes to class 10 minutes late and expects us to sit and be quiet the whole time while he is gone? Like really? And he gave us study guides which would have been helpful if some of it was ACTUALLY on the test. That is all.
6518,"He is a very nice and cool person, but extremely unknowledgeable about AP world history. He doesn't even try to teach anything and everyday is a free day. He said at the beginning of the year that he would probably get a 3 on the AP test. Now I realize that is a generous estimate. Mr. Taber tries way to hard to get on the good side of the kids. I love talking to Mr. Taber about football and things like that, but he is an unqualified teacher."
