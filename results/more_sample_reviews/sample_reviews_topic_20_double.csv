8,Really hard... but not if you're BRILLIANT! Just remember to be BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!
16,Liberal. Enough said.. She pushes her thoughts and opinions on others by leading questions and bias information. Such a hypocrite.
25,"Imbarrato was so focused on her own opinions, she didn't listen to students. She just preaches, and it's obnoxious even when I agree with her."
33,"Amat loqui de sociali vita, quae aliquando inconveniens. Ludunt ludis omni tempore et non in fossis inveni eos. EGO sentio amo ego didici omnino nihil. Paenitet Mrs Hahn."
41,He should totally team up with Ms. Elardo. They are both Republicans and they are both very opinionated.
50,"Such a biased teacher, tries to brainwash student...Bread not bombs, shove that pin where the sun don't shine."
58,"Tried to impose his draft-dodging spinless view on the class. Not intelligent, completley out of his league compared to other teachers"
67,"Can be over opinionated, does not like.to be contradicted about opinions or if she is misinformed continues to insist only on her views."
75,"good thing she left when she did; won't be endangering any more minds here, DOES NOT know her history, biased, not a very open view on the world"
83,Your the worst and most borining history teacher i have ever had and i love history. you have ruin this year for me.
92,"he was my art/ humane letters teacher. My final for the Civil War was a crossword puzzle (Grant was the answer to two questions). During art, he couldn't even draw a box"
100,"his emotional rants preclude any rational discourse. teaching should involve a healthy exchange of ideas, but if you disagree with him, you're belittled... even though he's wrong!"
109,"Your class is drawing and painting, when are we going to paint? Oh yeah and what is up with the Kermit The Frog Doll?"
117,"She is very opinionated and does not teach objectively. If you disagree with her, you will struggle in her class."
125,"alright. the thumb is here, the index finger's here, the pinky's here, the middle finger's here, andumwhaddya call this finger again?"
134,She was different than the other gym teachers. VERY different. Very colorful. i didn't think she was aware of the dress code at schoold either.
142,"she doesnt care about you oppinion. only hers, dont try to persuade her you are ever right, she will tear you down"
151,"i thought that when you teach art, you make people love it. she does the exact opposite. very uncreavtive and dull."
159,"If you enjoy being captive to pro-socialist discussions, you will love Petek. If you hate our military, you will love Petek. If you think Capitalism is the scourge of mankind, you will love Petek. Thank you LC for pushing an agenda on you students and not allowing free thought and discussion in the classroom."
167,"I hated her class with a passion. Her opinion was the only one allowed in the classroom, and if you didn't agree with it, then you didn't matter."
176,"Her constant repitiion of the words ""ultimately"" and ""okay"" make it immposible to take her seriously."
184,"Dont touch her things, YOU'LL GET GERMS ON THEM! and if you dont want charcole on your silk shirts, then either change shirts or change prfessions! oh, and P.S. YOU NEED MORE DEMENTION!"
193,"She is horrible. She says she ""cant read pencil"". Which is such bs. GET GLASSES! She also does not wear a bra to school, and wears suggestive clothing that a school teacher should not be wearing."
201,She presents a highly biased view of history. She should make her courses more balanced. They are too feminist and left-winged now. Take the challenge Ms. Fields!
209,"Legendary Test Question: ""To what countries could I jetski to from the island of Cyprus?"" I like how Ms. Henderson decided to close the wall and ask us about our day with Ms. J after a while. rofl"
218,"Ultimately adamant with his own form of teaching. Those who don't adapt to it well fail, period. Funny, but close-minded."
226,Quality? Some people just don't get it. This man's a legend and that doesn't happen by itself. A thousand devoted students can't be wrong.
235,I believe she works us students to death on taks when taks is important yes but sat on the other hand is equally important she focuses way to much on taks.
243,"she LOVES seniors especially if the class is filled with them. she bashes underclassmen to the seniors. however, if you have your own opinion, keep it to yourself cause what you write should be her opinion =/"
251,"Has no idea that other religions even exist and he's a HISTORY teacher. Harassing. Demeaning. And serves no purpose other than to bring other christians down. Get in politics, get out of the school."
260,"Holtzdog might be a grnius, but he doesn't know how to teach. The funny hing is that he would debate me on historical facts that he totally misconstrued."
268,Do not fear alumni. She never gave me more than an 85 on anything and now I am a published writer! An 85 in her world = 100 in the REAL world!
277,"Emotional arguer rather than intellectual discusser. Taught opinion more than fact. Not open to discussion. NOT knowledgeable of history, my grad school major."
285,"Has a socialistic political agenda that he tries to sneak into class, which would be fine if he owned up to it."
293,"Mrs Fasano is narrow minded and intolerant of all views but her own. She does not explain religion, only says that if it is in the textbook then it must be true. Her class is a complete waste of time"
302,"too much hw n proj. too borin and slow. ""you have a ll the time in the world"" is just an expression!!!"
310,Awful teacher. My religion class turned into a political debate class because he could not separate his political opinion from teaching. His also is not dedicated during the class prayer which is very disappointing for person that teaches religion class.
319,she is such a weird person. u dont get a good grade unless u share her opinion on things. a teacher is supposed to be open to other ideas.
327,worst drawing teacher i ever had. he has no creativity what so ever. and he's very rude. he ruined drawing for me forever. im a decent artist but he gives you no option to be creative about your assgi
335,"Does not appreciate greatness, or for that matter eccentricity. Does not understand History is diverse in its intepretation. Should read textbook, and you will be alright."
344,mr. balistreri is innapropriate in the classroom setting and has no ability to relate to students. he shoves his opinions on everyone and has no respect for diverse views.
352,She made me feel like I wasn't good at art and she didn't appreciate my piece in fashion. didn't really value time we had in class
360,"This teacher likes to tell us that only her opinion counts, and if we disagree with her in literature then we are wrong"
369,She doesn't accept any opinion but hers. Proving her wrong is impossible in her eyes. Not very fun or flexible with her units. SWITCH OUT NOW.
377,after going to a different school and comparing one history teacher to her i am convinced that she is one of the worst teachers i have ever had. very nice- oh yes. but unorganized & has no authority
386,"She sux. she cant even pronounce terms right. Her information is biased, she forces her religious beliefs on students.Theres a reason 4 sparating church & state"
394,"when i had her, she basically graded everything based on 1) whether she liked you, 2) if she agreed with your opinion"
402,We R chapin... lets get real we have always been chapin and he is not going to change that.. where is a poem for that one??
411,"Ms. Poth handed me an essay back today, and on the paper it said that I did not have size 12 font. I most certainly did have size 12 font; I compared it to everybody else's who had size 12 font and I double-checked on my computer when I got home. I would rather sit through an extremely boring regular English class than continue her class. She is extremely uptight and she will not accept an opinion (or fact) different than what she believes. She should not be a teacher."
419,"Very Stubborn women, has lots of favorites and likes only those who view the world she does. ITS ALWAYS HER WAY OR NO WAY AT ALL."
428,Made me hate art. Who did she think she was? I was lucky to get accepted in to art school after the garbage she taught me.
436,"WOW Mrs. Kissinger needs a chill pill. During Civil War studies, she made us shout ""Yes sir!"" when asked a question and gave us points for how loud we shouted."
444,"I would write a rage review, but it would exceed 500 characters. To keep it short, Ms. Boteilho is the worst teacher I ever had."
453,"She is unfair, and doesnt stick to what she says. She bases her opinion of you on what others say. She is not a nice woman."
461,He's quick to foist his own political views upon students when he should just let them choose for themselves like an actual govt/eco teacher should.
470,Biased. Can't make up her mind about her ideas. Seems to claim that other people are less open minded than her... not true. Not very smart.
478,Exactly as the person below me said. I once was graded down for having an opposing political stance. Do not teach politics if you can't be objective about your teachings and respect others opinions.
486,"I agree with these negative reviews and then some. While other teachers read/teach classics, you get a choice in her class of Flight or The Red Tent, but it doesn't matter because no one reads the books anyway."
495,Just aweful. The worst kind of teacher. If I had listened to her I wouldnt be where I am today on top of the world! I would never allow her to teacher my kids. EVER.
503,"worst teacher i have ever had by far. feminist who does not tolerate anyone else's views, and to get a good grade, you have to pretend to have the same political views. also very arbitrary"
512,I am very dissapointed with this teacher and his beliefs that he pushes onto his students. Monogomay and his personal beliefs should not be intorduced into the classroom!
520,She spends way too much time gosipin with people than teaching then expects us to pull this information out of thin air.....and get everythin right on the hw
528,"I find him to be really hypocritical. He says he's all about thinking for one's self, yet he can't take any criticism or reasonable disagreement without being defensive and constantly tries to force his opinions down our throats. He hears only what he wants to hear."
537,"her class is too tough... she tells you that you just read whats on the top and to read what the ""underlying theme"" is, and then when you do, its ""too deep"""
545,Mrs. Peacock is one of the most vile Dean I have ever met in my entire life. She is very discriminatory and holds very conservative beliefs which are very prevalent if your dress coded.
554,"Her global studies class is an atrocity of the human spirit, it's the real global issue."
562,"Brown is a sweet lady, but she is out of her league when it comes to teaching art in a high school setting. At times a bit closed-minded, Brown is rarely helpful and often forgetful."
570,"TTM... twardy's tape mix. pumpin iron to mortal combat, and of course the classic... its raining men. 30 sec break. go!"
579,"not open to the opinions of others. self-righteous. i honestly believe she believes she's running things the right way, yet almost all students dont like her ""regime""."
587,She has biast ideas on subjects in civics and teaches her own ideas. She had us watch all these news stations BUT FOX news which is the only conservative one.
596,"She doesn't care what your opinion is if it's different than hers! She told our class, ""oh stop arguing, just agree with me!"" I haven't offended her in any way she picks on me and takes my grade down!"
604,he is way to closed minded and will put anyone down if they do not have the same beliefs as he does. judges everyone and is very unclear and always needs to be right. but deep down is a good person
612,"During Creative Writing, she'd have us draw cards with markers for holidays, or write poems which wouldn't be read. She'd gossip wth the popular kids while we wasted our time."
621,WORST TEACHER EVER! she can take all of her 20 lb packets and her evil laughs and shove 'em......where the sun doesnt shine...
629,"wen it tym 2 teech...itz tym 2 teach, wen it tym 2 cook...itz tym 2 cook, dont do them both @ da same time!"
638,"I was one of the parents who she would actually allow to help out, and I can say not one good word about this woman's true character."
646,"She has analyzed thousands of poems, shorts, and novels but I doubt she has experienced a single one. And that Mrs. Boswell is what writing and literature is truly about."
654,"I agree, what's with the lab coat? he even wore it for NHS when evry1 else had suits on... also, why didnt u go to nam? u got ""physically sick?"" yea right"
663,"You are the best...love you..P.S.I had you two years ago...I made CACX in your eco class, the project...You rock!!"
671,"I've never been in a class before where I haven't learned a single thing the entire year, but Euro with Mr. Witmer proved me wrong. He doesn't teach, skips important events in history (i.e. World War II and the Holocaust) and is extremely confusing."
