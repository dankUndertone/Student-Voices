40,It is sad when a well respected educational institution is forced to continue to employ personnel of such low quality purely in the name of tenure. Hoffman is a shining example of the failures of the tenure system and a true detriment to the Â“excellence
53,"When our older daughter was at Mayfield the Conservatory had much higher standards and more qualified artist educators. Unfortunately, most recently, the program itself has seriously slipped in quality. Mayfield was at one time known for its stellar art program and high standards, the best arts in the area. This is no longer the case and sadly, I don't believe Mrs Darnell is the program's best promoter."
67,"she assgins so much work that it is very stressful and overwhelming, she has no personality and is dusty and irrelevant"
80,"After I was accepted to M.I.T., Mrs. Couthard suggested that I go to New River for a year to ""get some requirements out of the way."" A veritable fountain of worthless advice."
93,Ms. Gibson-Linkh is easily the worst principal working in Orange County. Her disrespect towards her teachers and students is legendary and blatently the by-product of her inability to believe she is capable of making mistakes. She should never have been elevated to a leadership position and it's almost criminal that she remains in one. Her position of power is easily Orange County School's biggest failure. Parents and teachers beware.
107,"With the little experience I've had with Amy Taylor, I can already guarantee that my youngest two children will not be attending Austin High if she is still the principal when they enter high school."
120,"Unsure if she is still teaching. Would be surprised! Hopefully, she is no longer working with children."
134,"A horrible administrator from whom I heard literal threats made to my entire grade. Her favoritism toward her daughters and their friends was stunning. It really made the school a difficult place and many students outside her daughters' circles were treated unfairly. Her lawsuit against the school is laughable, firing her was long overdue."
147,Is there a particular reason so many teachers have left? Is there a deliberate plan to get rid of experience? Or is it that quality teachers won't work with incompetence?
161,"Mrs Keen, I had back in 1995. I have left high school, graduated college and am now currently a sixth grade teacher.I cannot describe how unmotivating and grouc"

201,"As a former student of hers who is now studying at an Ivy League school, I can honestly say that her teaching has made me a successful college writer."
214,"This complete turd persecuted and harassed me and my family through constant meetings, personal questions, and fabrication of claims against us. This culminated in a report based on fabricated information that could have been easily debunked through any simple research to Child Services. All this was due to her disagreeing with my high school choices and trying to force me to not go to Stuyvesant. Stay away from her and you'll be more or less fine :(."
228,"Just about the worst teacher I've had at Prep, neglected to truly survey lit, ought to be teaching in a public school in Harlem, obsessed with NYC, a true troll in every way"
241,"Kenneth Crook is a teacher NOT a professor according to my research so far.
No teaching credentials found....this worries me.
UVU students need degrees to excel in the workplace but UVU hires it's teaching staff based on experience only?"
254,"Takes speech way to seriously. Considering his monotone mannerism, it's ironic that he's a speech teacher."
268,"Do I really have to cope with Mr. Killeen again this year? I am dreading school already. He is super flaky and is the least Catholic person in the entire school. He is a fraud. We may have won awards, but it's because of the teachers (who all left)."
281,I had high hopes when she came and I've been continually dissapointed. She is unprofessional and leads with fear. She's not the leader she needs to be and the school is sufferning.
295,"I have never had a professor that provided less clarity and brutal evaluations with no feedback. This was the most unbelievably frustrating academic experience I have had at the undergraduate, masters or doctoral level. In fact, this experience has me contemplating finding another program outside of Walden University. Dr. Haugen provides little input on what he is looking for in assignments and nearly no feedback on what he sees wrong with an assignment."
308,"Mr. Russell, does not fit the mold of a great teacher, he lacks in so many different areas as it relates to teaching, being a professional and a role model. Overall he demonstrates poor leadership ski"
322,"I had him in '94-'95, and in 4 years of HS and 4 years of college, one of the WORST teachers I've ever experienced"
335,His Policy of mass-punishment is unfair. He Punishes the entire school for the offences of a few students.
348,Teacher needs to remove political bias out of classroom. Very disappointed when I found out.
362,i cant believe that the district appointed such a nieve woman to direct a high school. even the dumbest students are smarter than her.
375,A professor that requires far too much just to take a course. APA style format for your own thoughts . Horrible class do not take her course or Robert Arruda's course
389,She is a bad teacher that shouldn't be allowed to work in education ever again.
402,"Why must you continue to believe that your libralism is so much better than any other political or moral belief? Public schools banned True/False for a reason, Brother."
415,"he removed my computer from the desktop wiht no warning to anyone how am i going to get to some of my documents now, hes so rude and inconsiderate"
429,On many occasions Mr. Williams seemed alarmingly unconcerned about my child's well being. My husband found the same lack of responsible interest when he tried to contact him. At least email back!
442,Not a spectacular counselor. Did not help me at all with scholarships or colleges for my field. Only referred me to somewhere else.
456,"The people whom wrote positive reviews must have been in an alternate universe. When I was a student of Mrs. Osazuwa's, she was disrespectful, unclear and unorganized."
469,my gpa is ruined nowhe makes us do push-ups in class just to reinforce into our brains and lower our already low self esteem that we are weaker than him in all facets of life
483,"I was not prepared for the final exam, my peers in other classrooms were much farther ahead and ultimately, learned much more than I did."
496,My experience with John Close as a student at one of his schools was entirely negative. I knew him to be an unkind and negative individual who offered nothing positive to my educational experience.
509,"So last year in APX...she gave our group advice, we followed it, and then got downgraded for including things she TOLD US TO INCLUDE. Hmm...clarity? I think not"
523,"If she thought she was as smart as she thinks she is she'd be great. Apparently, she comes from a long line of exceptional educators. Wow, if she does and if they are any reflection on her teaching and education ability we are in trouble!"
536,After speaking with her it is obvious why she could only receive a P.E. degree. P.E. teachers should be required to obtain an academic degree if they want to teach.
550,"in high school now. if i could name one mistake i made in middle school that would effect me in the long run, it would be selecting french as my language."
563,NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON STAFFING IN THE WEAK AREAS. Continue to eliminate weak teachers and stress academics not gimics.

590,I felt a total disconnect between the professor and student body. She seemed distracted and completely disinterested in furthering my education.
603,"I think Ms. Baxter has every intention of helping but is too overwhelmed with her different positions at school, that she forgets that she has offered help in the first place."
617,"Don't believe the recent ""spray"" of fan mail for this very bad teacher. He does not have a low numerical overall quality rating, and zero, nada, der absolute Nullpunkt, for popularity for no reason."
630,"She likes me so she's nice to me, but I can honestly say that I have never seen her make any positive changes at franklin."
644,"Average to less than average. Clearly the kids don't like her at all. They say she is daft and inexperienced, but I like her jokes."
657,"Highest salary at Maple, and he gives nothing back. He is the laziest teacher I ever had. I suffered 2 years with him (7th and 8th grade). He never did activities because of his lack of creativity."
670,Not a good guidance counselor. I had to work all by myself when getting into college. Failed to check my transcript that was full of errors and because of it i got denied from my first choices.
684,"Was very disappointed with his teaching. Our student quickly became disinterested and is simply going through the motions until graduation. Has the potential to be an amazing teacher, but still has a long way to go."
697,"Should not be allowed to teach, she pushes her personal opinions in the name of freedom of speech, an activist in the classroom"
711,he's a gr8 example why teachers shouldn't be tenured. how does the administration NOT know he only really works 1 class a day when he records himself???? the WORST ever excuse for quality learning
724,"he really should be teaching high school, not 7th. ive been degrated since i walked into that room and have been since."
737,mr.carter just needs to retire because he has the highest student failure rate at maury high school he doesn't teach the class if the majority don't do hmwk.
751,"are there any requirements for physical education curriculum? i am under the impression that there are not, otherwise perhaps we would do something requiring physical activity and we would no longer play golf."
764,Our family was expecting a unique approach to learning. We are finding this experience to be unsatisfactory in many of the critical learning areas.
778,"Mr. Meyers is responsible for conducting the top orchestra in the school, however he has no experience conducting such an ensemble, he is never prepared forclas"
791,"If you're a student planning to take ""Lighting and Sound"" at our high school take my advice; DON'T. What started out as a fun and straightforward class in the beginning of the year this past September has now spiraled into chaos and confusion at every turn. Our class has dropped from a total of 12 students at the beginning of the year to a point where now only 8 remain in the entire course. Exams are difficult and have NO relation to what we've been told is important. Stick to teaching English!"
805,"she asked us where the auditorium was in the high school. she has worked there for, oh about 20 years. is she kidding?"
818,She is horrible! She ruined my first year in high school. I can't believe she's been teaching for 40 years. She is incapable of teaching due to her stupidity and lack of compassion.
831,"Foley is a nice guy, but an exceedingly inadequate choral director. Hiring him to take over such a huge, well established program was a devastating mistake, and the SME choral department has suffered immensely quality wise."

872,"tasks too few points, many notes, students not only learn by copying many notes, should make the class more dynamic"
885,"Mr. Finken, retired in Iowa as a middle school principal, and is often absent or leaving early from his responsibilities from his job. He currently lives in Iowa and has never been a part of the community, let alone our state. He fools some by saying he has a room at Hotel Wilber, or more recently an apartment in Beatrice, but is never seen in those locations. This lack of integrity and work ethic by Mr. Finken has allowed Mr. Uher to run rampant. He has no more integrity than Mr. Uher!!!"
898,"She used to be awesome but the past two years she's just been really mean, but its only because she's getting us ready for college... NOT, I had her for 4 years"
912,He is more concerned with making the school an ap school than the excessive failure and violence that is actually happening.
925,"One of the sweetest ladies I have ever met. However, she is incapable of controlling a classroom due to PTSD from an incident with a student a few years ago that resulted in her having a miscarriage. She also isn't very clear in her teaching and does not follow through on the promises about her class she makes at the beginning of the year. We didn't come close to having hw every day and I'm still waiting for the third instalment of ""Element Friday"". Lastly, this is not a ""college prep course"""
939,"Dr. Shwamb is hated by many. I have not a single ounce of respect for her since the day I walked into forsythe in the 6th grade. I acknowledge the fact that she has been teaching for many years, but I don't see any talent or constructive teaching coming from her."
952,"He talks poorly about the school district. Told me that he was ""sorry I have to graduate with a Milford High School diploma."""
966,"Doesn't turn in all college stuff in on time, have to constantly call and email for recommendations, and pushes state schools"

992,"Very disorganized, doesnt know what she's doing when it comes to dealing with Drama classes. Then again is not her major, she can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Her lack of responsability is also atrocious."
1006,She didn't contact me when I left messages for her and she never returned my emails. I feel that she doesn't make if very clear on how to get an A in her class. Very unclear!
1019,"Looking back at high school, Mrs. Spangenberg always seemed like a very unhappy person. I hope she has found a way to focus on the good things at Dow!"
1033,"I remember correcting the guy more than once. Overall, the class was as dry as sandpaper. I offer my deepest condolences to anyone who may have the utter misfortune of being his pupil in the future."
1046,most boring class i ever took. i have difficulty understanding why she was awarded her teaching certificate. -CG
1059,"This is a teacher whose record keeping practices are, in my opinion, sloppy; whose commentary on student papers appears to reflect a careless reading; and whose propensity to allow these things to carry over into her report writing borders on what might be termed incompetent through including factual inaccuracies about student performance in her end-of-term reports. She does not communicate enough with parents before a problem has ballooned to the point that it cannot be corrected."
1073,"After reading posts on social media made by Mr.Coleman,I was honestly taken back by the way he conducts himself when speaking to others. I no longer feel comfortable with my daughter taking his classes since that is the example he has decided to set."
