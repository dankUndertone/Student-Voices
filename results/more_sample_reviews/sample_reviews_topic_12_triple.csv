130,"OMG! I am in high school now, and I still have nightmares about Lambert. He made my eighth grade year a living nightmare!"
163,Mr. Peterson was terrible. I put a lot into my work in his class and I only got complimented when every other teacher in the school noticed.
196,He was so abnoxious! I got an A in the class but thats only because of Ms. B! She should be conducting NOT him! He never let us out of class on time!
228,if you see her name on your roster in the summer... change it as soon as you can. she is Horrbile with a capital H.
261,My one friend took the card out from under the magnet where he put it in between classes. The ONLY good time I have ever had while he subbed.
294,mrs northrup is very unorganized she messed up my grade and my friends gave me a detention for being tardy when shes tardy in the morning and everyone waits outside her class room for 5-10min
326,"For a counselor, you'd think she'd be helpful, but sadly she isn't. She told me to ""leave"" her room as she had, and I quote, ""more things to do."""
359,She took several days to return emails if she returned them at all. Thank goodness she isn't there anymore.
392,she is so negative. Every day we just enter the classroom and she starts yelling st us. I wish we had MRs. Hutteman.
424,He was so mean and he gave us work and he said it would all help me on the regents. Practically 2% of what he said was on the regents
457,i had her a year ago and she thought she was so cool when she gave the spelling test. i am glad she broke her finger she deserved it.
490,"She was pretty much awful the entire year. as soon as i left her math class i was extatic, and when i walked in her room one day i forgot everything. thanks to ms.emanuel i got a 600 o my math SOL"
523,I didn't like Miss Bhatnagar when I had her in tenth grade but she was kinda okay last year but I did have to take summer school because of her.
555,I've gotten all A's in his class but he puts down C's on my report card. I've done almost all my homework and he insists I haven't done any. I hate this teacher
588,"SHE'S HARD, SHE'S A BAD TEACHER... AND EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO HER EVERY ADVISORY FOR HELP... I STILL FAILED THE CLASS..."
621,"I hated her. I got Cs all year with her, the only year ever, and now I'm getting As. She told me I was getting a B and gave me a C. Very unhelpful and cold."
653,"He wasn't there most of the time, we had a sub almost the whole year. When parent teacher conferences came, he couldn't even remember my name. I would not like to have him ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
686,"WAS GIVING MY GOOD GRADES TO ANOTHER STUDENT THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER. WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT IT,SHE GOT MAD AND SAID IT WAS MY FAULT,CUZ OF OUR ALIKE LAST NAME"
719,"one time my sister showed her she was wrong and she made my sister feel bad in front of the class. when my sister brought in proof, Ms. Swovelin never apologize"
751,"One year I had her for english. I had a quiz done in January and didn't get it back untill the end of the school year that said ""see me please"". You never got your work back untill the yearend."
784,"I am a sophmore at SRHS now and i can finally get away from this guy. He subbed for about a month in 8th grade, and everyone in the class bombed the test. It almost kept me from getting to go on the ECT.PS: He has sweaty armpits"
817,"ok lets see, week 2 right? 4 people walked out 2nd day of school to get a new class. I cant say much now but i see no structure and no reason for that to change."
849,one bad experience with her and she'll hate you throughout the year. i got stuck in the back corner of the class and NEVER moved!!
882,I hated her! I had her for homeroom and she wouldn't let us leave during STAR for anything not even the bathroom! She found out who my friends boy friend was and always bugged her about him!
915,she gives out detension to every tardy you have. The vice principal told me she uses the most detention slips everyday.
948,"Had her when I was in 2nd grade, and was all over students. What do I mean? She was kind of pushy about students education too much. She took us out to recess too often and didn't teach much. I had a pencil on my desk, and she took it away and literally gave it back at 2:00, the end of the day. I couldn't do any work throughout the day!!"
980,got my schedule and it said hunter i was so happy until someone told me it was k hunter i wanted not j. argh.
1013,"i neede a 65 or better on the math a regents to graduate and she made mr.joe find some extra points, so i could graduate.class of ""04"".shes ok."
1046,"Ignorant. Kept mispronouncing my last name, after nicely correcting her several times she took offence and sent me to the office and gave me a zero which is a totally reasonable thing to do right??"
1078,the worst teacher i've ever had. she didnt even teach and i ended up having trouble in algebra 2 after i took this class
1111,she once made the whole class take an extra grammar quiz because i threw a pencil
1144,Mr Nelson never called on me or my friends when I was in 7th grade. Me and all my freind were on the basketball team so he called us popular and made fun of us. Me and my friends had the highst grade
1176,"wow mr. Icavano it was so e-z to getout of class and out of school with you, thanks here's a hint i have been in your office every month in 05 to 06 year, yeah its me the _______ I was in Kestlingers"
1209,She is terrible. I missed class for two days because I had health issues and the day I came back I asked her what I missed. She just handed me two papers and left. I assumed that is all we did but the day of the test she started talking about a triangle. I got an F on the test. (My first ever) and she offered a retake. Although I could only get a C on it. I told her about how I was gone and she just said next time and left. TRY TO GET OUT OF HER CLASS!
1242,i had her when she was a long term sub for ms shumpert.. tha 1st part of her name really describes her. glad im out of there
1274,I missed a test cuzz I was out of town then he had all of these subs so I couldn't make up my test when he came back he said it was 2 late to make up the test!!
1307,i dunno what these guys are talkin about. mrs. most always seemed bored or mad. she even rolled her eyes at us!
1340,Ms.hamler has told me that i needed to be home schooled I took that to heart and find that very disrespectful she also sat me all the way in the back of the class with the computer that doesn't work
1372,"september 23rd, 20,000. the year was 20,000 for a whole week. we WATCHED her write it... oh and i skipped her class 19 times freshman year and got caught once. by the sub."

1503,"get this. I AM NOT YOUR FRIEND. i still like u even though you always call on me when i am lost or talking to some1. as i said, i still like you. i learn a lot."
1536,"I hate her. I usually get B's and up for classes, but she gave me a C, and for a stupid and unfair reason. I was absent for a week of school, and during that week I missed two wksts and an exam. When I came back, I tried to take the exam and do the wkst's, but she said she was ""too busy"" and ""I need to get work done"". This happened to me three times. Then, she sent home the repot card, and it said that I was a nice student, I just need to start coming after class because I hadn't taken the exam."
1569,we watched a movie the last day of school when all the other global language classes didnt have to come so we walked out and he wrote us up. thanks a lot pajor
1601,"The only time I ever spoke to him, he yelled at me for what was a mistake, and wouldn't let me tell me speak... just kept on yelling..."
1634,"""Holding it down"" is about the best thing we've learned from this guy. ""Ok, Chapter 8...yada yada yada....test tomorrow."""
1667,WORST TEACHER EVER!I had 90s in math EVEry yEAr this year i fail midterm and he REFUSED to go over it then kicked me out into the hall when i asked why..if u get him GET OUT NOW!!!
1699,"i was in the hall for 2 weeks straight once,after the 3rd day she would tell me to go in the hall before the bell even rang! i was like WHAT DID I DO, unclear, nice,EZ but unclear."
1732,I didn't like you too much! You didn't explain the boxes very well and i got a 0 cause you lost my paper!!!! I got my 1st B in your class!! :'(
1765,"I had Ms. Bobeck last year and I didn't learn a thing. I failed the last four tests and still got an A in the class, ha what a great teacher! *rolls eyes*"
1797,"Too many days, Mr. Sommer was absent. I taught my daughter science at home since the subs just supervised."
1830,So we finnaly disected the Worm and A Frog. It was okay. But Now on Friday we start class and he writes your MAJOR TEST TODAY has been prosponed till Monday when he NEVER even told us about the TEST?!
1863,Chapman was horrible. i missed one hw and she called my parents and told them lies about me. she hated me and favored all the brainiacs in the class. no help
1896,i love that i get to talk all during class since i hav a friend in thur. but all these softmores r in my class. did they fail last yr? i can tell how they could
1928,"terrible teacher, takes forever to grade things. I had a 96 for the whole quarter which dropped to an 89 the last day of the quarter. Always late or sick or both. Just not a very good teacher"
1961,Really confusing if you don't have friends in your class. Never knew what was going on for the first half of the year.
1994,"Every time I go back, I avoid seeing him. He taught like a sub (very little) and preached to much. I guess he is doing what he was trained for now...subbing!"
2026,"well you tought me nothing, and you really need to go back to school cuz than so many kids would not fail your class. try helping us out next time!!!"
2059,I took 3 years of french in high school and my last year i had mr. teahan. I am now in french 101 in college and i still am having a hard time because i forgot everything thanks to this class. Horrible class.
2092,she never lets us go to the bathroom! then she says whatever isnt necessary for the class we cant go get. how is our binders not necessary for the class!
2124,"Okay, I understood things better when my friend helped me out then when Mr. Messman would ignore me when I raised my hand."
2157,"SWITCH OUT NOW. I asked for help every single time I needed it but was denied. Finally, when the whole class insisted, she was very unclear and difficult."
2190,"Does not know how to teach. He is still a fun teacher, but he does not know how to teach.I have been going to ALL (almost everyday of the week) of his extra help after school and still am failing his class."
2222,"She is absent a lot, is often late to class (or misses the entire class). No learning is taking place but we all have high A averages."
2255,"She is an awful woman. My son comes home upset everyday, and he finally told me why. He said it was MS.backes. I didn't think it was anything big, so I left it alone. About a week later he called me and told me that she screamed at him, and that he had to file a BULLY REPORT on her. I talked to him and he didn't want me to email HER because he said she would send him to the principles office, like she did to another child. I talked to the school and they said they would talk to her, but..."
2288,"she is a horrible teacher, she yells all the time she has no patience it would be good if she left the school it would help the whole school."
2320,"Mr. Vogt is a man who should was not worth my time. i spent weeks in his room after school and before and eve went to tutoring. he always said just ""read the book"". He was rude and vulgar."
2353,"This year she had eye surgery so everyones feeling bad for her when she comes in and all she does in complain again. I cant stand her anymore, if you get her instead of mayercheck in 7th, get switched"
2386,I only had your class for 4 weeks but I didn't like you from the start and you gave to many assigments. as well most of the stuff we did in you class BS
2419,this teacher is very bad. she grades so low to people who are not friends wit her and giives ridicul;ously high grades to the juniors who r friends wit her
2451,i just have her for homeroom but she does unnessesary things like yelling at you three times even when you do nothing wrong
2484,Gave WAY too much xtra credit...If you had under 100% in that class... you know you are doing something wrong.
2517,"Went to school with my sister and they didn't get along, so she took it out on me. Was in her early days of teaching when I had her, so I hope she has become more inspired since then. Boring and distracted, though not very challenging. Easy grader."
2549,Thanks for the 52 on the lab mrs. copeland. Ill try to remeber the half-life of popcorn kernals next time
2582,"I have to agree with most, I see I wasn't the only one she called stupid. I was called out many times in the class room and actualy made fun of by her.Thanks alot for good teaching"
2615,"I hate her.
she gave me a 65 on a journal check and I had just about all my journal entries.also, she called my home because I didn't get a deficiency signed, but NOBODY did,
but who's house does sh"
