157,Ms. Busa has to use a calculator for her lessons and that makes hard for us students to understand her.
315,shes terrible for extra help. in my class only the kids with tutors are doing well. basically if u have her ur screwed
472,I have her as a math focus teacher. She isn't really helpful when it comes time to explain things.
630,Good teachers that know her stuff. But when it comes to teaching she is not good at all. She jumps around topics and is very confusing. She is also very strict and an immigrant.
788,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Everyone in class ends up trying to teach each other because she can't explain anything.
945,he is an okay teacher...does not prepare you for anything though...and can be very difficult to understand at times.
1103,Can't understand her at all. She messes up simple math quite often and is overall bad at teaching.
1261,She can't keep her classes' attention long enough to make everyone understand and gets frusterated when nobody understands what she didn't teach.
1418,I could never understand if this teacher was all their.She seemed intelligent but I had my doubt's sometime's.Her class is hard and expects alot out of her students
1576,"the explanations she gives are impossible to understand, and the exams don't make any sense.
Teachers need to understand their subject before trying to teaching it to students."
1734,she isn't very helpful and is not a very good teacher for this subject. she doesn't listen very well to students and does not try to help them.
1891,"god, it's so difficult to understand this man. He can pronounce the words ""football"" and ""half"" bad wrestling coach too."
2049,"Horrible at explaining, you ask her a question and she answers something completely different. Doesn't make sure everyone understands the material before moving on, and isn't thorough on anything."
2206,"Really struggle to understand this teacher, she means well but is not able to get ideas across, then gets angry and waves her hands a lot when no one understands."
2364,"I really don't like her way of teaching. Her lessons are basically the formulas or whatever one could find by himself in the summary section of the textbook. Barely teaches us how to apply those formulas. Goes super fast. Spends too much time making students put the homework on the board and explain the questions by ourselves, which is not helpful to most of the other students. Her class is the reason for me to think that I dislike math for the first time."
2522,"Not a good counselor, made everything (scheduling classes, college applications, scholarships)difficult, and never helpful with other problems;Often tried to limit students and have them underachieve"
2679,He is rude and micromanages EVERYTHING. He makes things needlessly complicated and insists everything be his way
2837,unless you're a math wiz and can self teach yourself math then great but other then that precalc honors was not pretty
2995,"She doesn't explain what she wants. She glosses over everything and leaves it up to the students to understand what she wants. If you want to be bored and confused, take her!"
3152,"didnt understand anything. maybe its just the subject, but she didnt help or make my life any easier."
3310,"Good person, clarity-clear as fog. Hard teacher to follow unless you go in for help, even then its a pitiful sight"
3468,I just can't learn from her. She doesn't teach well at all! She's so cute and nice but her class is super hard unless you're good at chemistry -_________-
3625,"She makes concepts already learned more complicated than it already is. This happens when she strays too far from the textbook- which she can't do. Also, her accent is very difficult to understand. Combined with her monotoned voice, she knocks half the class out. She also shows favoritism to those who do well, and show signs of disgust at those who are struggling because they can't understand her. Her reviews do not match the tests. She often rushes through before students even master concepts."
3783,"He is not very good at explaining what we are supposed to do. He always confuses me, and he tends to scream at other students, which scares some of us. Most of us are afraid to ask him a question, or if we do. He does not exlpain it throughly."
3941,"Really just a ""here's a worksheet, fill it out"" type of teacher. Even when she does try to explain something, she gets frustrated if you don't understand and moves on."
4098,"a good person but can't teach for her life, makes frequent mistakes and is not very clear. she should NOT be teaching honors"
4256,Very bad never tries to help students- boring class bad books to many essays not enough education
4413,"Ms. Sundri, is a bad teacher. She go fast and is hard to understand. She is mean and takes points off for everything."
4571,"Just can't teach. her notes are useless! she doesn't have a great understanding of material herself, from what I gathered."
4729,She was the worst math teacher ever. She gets off topic soooo much! I did so bad in her class I got moved down in math.
4886,"a very sweet woman, but it's really difficult to understand her all of the time. i understand that she has difficulties, but it really limits her as a teacher."
5044,ms. adams you were a hard teacher and I am glad i am done with your class have fun trying to teach other students.
5202,"Not the ideal teacher. She is a very harsh grader and is very hypocritical. At times, she can be understanding- but that is a rare circumstance."
5359,"This guy has no buisness teaching Math. Very soft spoken, no control over class room and dosent explain Math at all."
5517,"Mr. Veader is actually a reacher that I dont really like, and lets just leave it at that. He is not at ALL clear and does not explain things clearly at all. Overall: very bad teacher."
5675,"mrs. taylor is a sweet lady but doesn't know how to control a class to save her life. also she can't comprehend and answer questions, OR teach any form of math."
5832,good teacher hardness but is a good teacher but i had some difficulty...i had trouble with the assighments and lots of other stuff
5990,"It's obvious he knows a lot about math, but does not relay it to his students well at all. VERY biased towards any Milton baseball/basketball player."
6147,she is not a very good teacher. she hardley trys to help you in class. she says you can come in after class and get help but she is still not that helpful. she piles on homework as if we are in colleg
6305,"Worst teacher I have ever had. Hates boys, doesn't teach. I taught myself everything this year. Tries to blame everything on the students when in actuality she doesnt teach us, but when she does she does one problem one time and expects you to understand the entire topic. Worst teacher ever i hope she gets fired. 0/10"
