78,Lobdell is a hard teacher. He teaches very badly and fast ! He doesn't explain the material very well.
157,Ms. Busa has to use a calculator for her lessons and that makes hard for us students to understand her.
236,"She has absolutely NO patience. She rushes through all the materials, and does not clarify anything to the students. Sometimes, she doesn't even know how to explain things."
315,shes terrible for extra help. in my class only the kids with tutors are doing well. basically if u have her ur screwed
394,"...I have had to help people in my class understand the most simple of things (and have had to get helped) because Mr. Miller makes everything simple impossible, and the hard...lets just not go there!"
472,I have her as a math focus teacher. She isn't really helpful when it comes time to explain things.
551,"Dr. Headly did not explain the material clearly, he easily loses his patience when asked to go over something they don't understand, and he does not make himself available for help outside of class."
630,Good teachers that know her stuff. But when it comes to teaching she is not good at all. She jumps around topics and is very confusing. She is also very strict and an immigrant.
709,Ms. Carlisle doesn't know anything. She gets mad for ridiculous reasons and doesn't explain anything.
788,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Everyone in class ends up trying to teach each other because she can't explain anything.
867,While lenient with homework - she considers copying from a projector teaching. She didn't help with the harder concepts at ALL.
945,he is an okay teacher...does not prepare you for anything though...and can be very difficult to understand at times.
1024,"Hate him all he does is laugh after everything he says, very unclear and expects class to fully understand all even though he doen't explain it well."
1103,Can't understand her at all. She messes up simple math quite often and is overall bad at teaching.
1182,"She stays after to ""help"" us, but she makes other students help us. Everyone doesn't get math. If they do, they ask smart people for answers"
1261,She can't keep her classes' attention long enough to make everyone understand and gets frusterated when nobody understands what she didn't teach.
1339,how did someone who can barely do math end up teaching haverford's most advanced math class? don't take BC!
1418,I could never understand if this teacher was all their.She seemed intelligent but I had my doubt's sometime's.Her class is hard and expects alot out of her students
1497,He's not good at teaching basic geometry... My son is failing because of this.
1576,"the explanations she gives are impossible to understand, and the exams don't make any sense.
Teachers need to understand their subject before trying to teaching it to students."

2206,"Really struggle to understand this teacher, she means well but is not able to get ideas across, then gets angry and waves her hands a lot when no one understands."
2285,"If you have him,Good luck! His teaching skills are poor. He moves way too fast and he doesn't know how to explain anything. He can not do basic math in his head. If you go for extra help outside of class time he doesn't provide much help at all! If you're stuck with him, get help from Mr. Sherman or teach yourself with the book!!"
2364,"I really don't like her way of teaching. Her lessons are basically the formulas or whatever one could find by himself in the summary section of the textbook. Barely teaches us how to apply those formulas. Goes super fast. Spends too much time making students put the homework on the board and explain the questions by ourselves, which is not helpful to most of the other students. Her class is the reason for me to think that I dislike math for the first time."
2443,"He's really hard to understand, doesn't care much about how we do the problems on the HW and doesn't know when a student needs to be switched to another math class because they are exceling in his."
2522,"Not a good counselor, made everything (scheduling classes, college applications, scholarships)difficult, and never helpful with other problems;Often tried to limit students and have them underachieve"
2601,Completely out of reality doesn't explain everything doesn't stay on topic blames everything on the students
2679,He is rude and micromanages EVERYTHING. He makes things needlessly complicated and insists everything be his way
2758,she talks about stuff that is not even math or science and doesn't teach us anything and when she doesn i dont understand it.
2837,unless you're a math wiz and can self teach yourself math then great but other then that precalc honors was not pretty
2916,"Her class isnt hard but she acts like we are all geniuses and should know how to everything without being taught. She has tutoring but normally wont help yu, just have you hang pasta from the ceiling"
2995,"She doesn't explain what she wants. She glosses over everything and leaves it up to the students to understand what she wants. If you want to be bored and confused, take her!"
3073,"Marshall could be the worst teacher there is for Precalc. Doesn't explain the material well enough, no step by step when teaching problems, and doesn't care that the class isn't ready to be tested."
3152,"didnt understand anything. maybe its just the subject, but she didnt help or make my life any easier."
3231,Mr. Dake fails to help the students when asked and quizzes and test were extreamly hard becuase he did NOT.. expalin enough
3310,"Good person, clarity-clear as fog. Hard teacher to follow unless you go in for help, even then its a pitiful sight"
3389,Worst teacher I have ever had. She makes everything confusing and NEVER teaches.
3468,I just can't learn from her. She doesn't teach well at all! She's so cute and nice but her class is super hard unless you're good at chemistry -_________-
3546,She has voice that makes it hard to understand her. I did not really respond well to her teaching style.
3625,"She makes concepts already learned more complicated than it already is. This happens when she strays too far from the textbook- which she can't do. Also, her accent is very difficult to understand. Combined with her monotoned voice, she knocks half the class out. She also shows favoritism to those who do well, and show signs of disgust at those who are struggling because they can't understand her. Her reviews do not match the tests. She often rushes through before students even master concepts."
3704,"She knows close to no actual Geometry of any sort of knowledge of Math. She can't do simple math in her head, for examples 0-6, and she doesn't explain anything. I'm not writing this cause I have a bad grade, I have a A+ in the class cause I get my dad to help me cause she can't explain anything with her limited knowledge for the life of her. She is super strict on showing you work to the point that you are forced to write down math that you can do in your head (that she can't)."
3783,"He is not very good at explaining what we are supposed to do. He always confuses me, and he tends to scream at other students, which scares some of us. Most of us are afraid to ask him a question, or if we do. He does not exlpain it throughly."
3862,She is very difficult to understand. She is a very nice person but she should teach something else.She even refused to answer my question on something I didn't know because she already said it. She also has a hard time understanding why her students are doing so bad.
3941,"Really just a ""here's a worksheet, fill it out"" type of teacher. Even when she does try to explain something, she gets frustrated if you don't understand and moves on."

4256,Very bad never tries to help students- boring class bad books to many essays not enough education
4335,"Will not go down as one of my good teachers. From what I hear this year, not many people like her either. She teaches unclearly and expects us to understand right away. Not a good teacher."
4413,"Ms. Sundri, is a bad teacher. She go fast and is hard to understand. She is mean and takes points off for everything."
4492,"I haven't even been in her class a whole year, but it's already rough. I never get bad grades in science, but this year im struggling. The closest thing to teaching she does, is making us copy down notes she won't explain, and half the time she's goes so fast you cant even finish taking them. She tells us about something new on the test a day before we get it."
4571,"Just can't teach. her notes are useless! she doesn't have a great understanding of material herself, from what I gathered."
4650,she's reallt boring!!!! also she's asumes that everyone has taken some sort of alg2 before...so she never really explained anything
4729,She was the worst math teacher ever. She gets off topic soooo much! I did so bad in her class I got moved down in math.
4808,"She gets distracted very easily and doesn't hold the class's attention. Rarely understood people's questions and never fully explained all of the material. She's a nice person, but..."
4886,"a very sweet woman, but it's really difficult to understand her all of the time. i understand that she has difficulties, but it really limits her as a teacher."
4965,she barely teaches the subject. pretty much expected us to do everything on our own. Doesn't really explain stuff well. shows up late to school. One time she gave us a really hard test and then made us correct it ourselves. nice though i guess
5044,ms. adams you were a hard teacher and I am glad i am done with your class have fun trying to teach other students.
5123,"Easiest class ever, just get on her good side and have an accent. Plus, do you homework( it doesn't even have to be thorough, it can be gibberish)"
5202,"Not the ideal teacher. She is a very harsh grader and is very hypocritical. At times, she can be understanding- but that is a rare circumstance."
5280,she is the worst teacher i have ever had. she doesnt explain ANYTHING and is really annoying! she is so bad at teaching and explaining things! i get so confused when she talks!!!!
5359,"This guy has no buisness teaching Math. Very soft spoken, no control over class room and dosent explain Math at all."
5438,I hated having her. She never explained anything and she had favorites( The perfect kids......) She tried to hard too!
5517,"Mr. Veader is actually a reacher that I dont really like, and lets just leave it at that. He is not at ALL clear and does not explain things clearly at all. Overall: very bad teacher."
5596,"Decent teacher, but goes on long rants if you don't do your work. Blames students for not studying, even though she did not teach us the material. If you sit in the back of the class, her handwriting is hard to read cause its in""script."". Favors people who speak French well and who had the language previously. Knows material but cannot teach well and does not answer questions, when she does she gets mad at you for not knowing the material. She talks about random topics a lot if you change it."
5675,"mrs. taylor is a sweet lady but doesn't know how to control a class to save her life. also she can't comprehend and answer questions, OR teach any form of math."
5753,"I dont understand her, shes teaching geometry this year but shes originally a computer teacher....she has no right doing this to us, we need to LEARN geometry!!"
5832,good teacher hardness but is a good teacher but i had some difficulty...i had trouble with the assighments and lots of other stuff
5911,"I made the unfortunate mistake of taking Schippers courses twice. She never teaches or explains the material, just gives us labs and doesn't explain how to do the math or how they relate, and if you want a good grade, you have to learn the material outside of class. I'm taking the class to learn how to do it in class, not to go home and look it up for 3 hours. She was nice and all, just doesn't explain the material well enough."
5990,"It's obvious he knows a lot about math, but does not relay it to his students well at all. VERY biased towards any Milton baseball/basketball player."
6069,Doesn't really know anything about math.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
6147,she is not a very good teacher. she hardley trys to help you in class. she says you can come in after class and get help but she is still not that helpful. she piles on homework as if we are in colleg
6226,"He is the worst teacher ever!He doesn't teach well, makes numerous mistakes in grading assignments, and homework as well as tests are soo hard! This is the only class I'm doing bad in."
6305,"Worst teacher I have ever had. Hates boys, doesn't teach. I taught myself everything this year. Tries to blame everything on the students when in actuality she doesnt teach us, but when she does she does one problem one time and expects you to understand the entire topic. Worst teacher ever i hope she gets fired. 0/10"
6384,"I liked Mr. Mott at first but in the third quarter he started piling on the work and giving tests so often, while expecting us to complete our PBA and juggle many extra-curricular activities. He's a teacher who lacks empathy and is super confusing. Wish he would slow down and realize that we're struggling because he goes to fast and ISN'T CLEAR AT ALL."
6463,"She can't teach. She skips a bunch of steps when doing problems and if you aren't naturally gifted in math, you'll fall behind easily. She's also pretty rude. She once asked our class if we understood a problem; most of us said no and she replied, ""Too bad. Moving on. You guys are in high school already. You figure it out."" Well, no, we can't if we don't understand what she's teaching. People complain about her broken English, but that's not a problem. It's her attitude and inability to teach."
6542,"Sims's class is awful. I couldn't understand anything and she definitely had favorites. It was clear to who her favorites were too. She tries to relate to her students which is cool, but her teaching is so boring... you can only wish to get out of the class."
6620,"had mr fannin in 10th grade, hated his class, bad teacher, can't explain ANYTHING when you ask him a why question, makes learning in general very difficult. made the rest of my science classes hard"
6699,She is not a helpful gal and is the single most confusing teacher I have ever had.
6778,"He expects us to understand material that he never went over, he is a nice guy but not the greatest teacher."
6857,"She is insanely hard to understand and is not insanely willing to help. Her class moves insanely fast and if you daze off for even a second and you arent a math brain you will be lost for the rest of the semester. Her test are difficult and she doesn't allow you to see them unless you go to her at lunch,because she is working with three other people. when she is barely able to acknowlege you . I am only in her class because last year i had a bad teacher but compared to her he is ok."
6936,"She doesn't necessarily teach the subject you are taking. For example, don't expect to learn how to screenpaint in screenpainting"
7014,Horrible he was really mean and does not make anything clear ans understandable
7093,"Don't even get me started... she doesn't explain things at all and expects us to know really hard math even when she explains it wrong to us, you ask her a question and she calls on somebody else in the middle of your question, when we run out of calculators for the test she says to do it without the calculator while everybody uses oneShe should at least try to explain things better"
7172,"He was very nice to me, but it was a tough class. He wasnt very clear on certain topics and refused to go over those again. He constantly told us to go in for tutoring but didnt help us when we did!"
7251,"Not sure how she passed elementary school, seeing as she can't do simple math. All of her assignments usually have SERIOUS grammatical and spelling errors."
7330,"Expects everyone to understand spanish, before she teaches it................... bad experience .............................................................."
7409,"Cant answere any questions clearly, and has the wierdest voices... Dont get her for Bio/Chem, she makes it very hard and anoying,her test are completely random"
7487,She's not the hardest teacher because I didn't say a word all term and still got a decent grade but she's hard to understand and can be unpleasant.
7566,"The class is easy, but a horrible teacher, any student could tell u that she doesnt teach, gives you the lab and just says do it and wouldnt explain if you dont understand. She doesnt explain anything"
7645,Had this professor for the current semester (Spring 2012) and I never understood anything that was happening! Not very clear in explaining course topics
7724,"She's very confusing and has disorganized plans for class. It's really confusing to know what you're supposed to be doing, what's homework, and what's due later"
7803,"She barely speaks English, her Spanish is impossible to understand, she makes nit hard to learn because she can't answers questions. Her homework is NEVER corresponding to the work in class. She has favorites and allows kids to blatantly cheat."
7882,"Lazaro is a fine cp geometry teacher... But in ""teaching"" honors algebra II she is a discrace. She doesn't teach anything, she does two maybe 3 examples and expects you to full comprehend the material. She teaches 3-5 topics a day. She taught right up to the day before the midterm, on which I got an F. She compares us to her 1 year old saying that she could do our work. she does nothing to help kids learn and discourages us from coming after school for extra help. Math class with her is hell."

8039,ms.borton is nice person but she gets way to ahead of herself and doesn't understand how people interpret information
8197,She gives so much homework! Her voice is so annoying! She stress's me out and I can not understand anything she is trying to explain.
8354,"Nice guy, terrible teacher. Makes you feel stupid when you ask a question. Talks wayyy too much about New Zealand and his ""kitties"" and other farm details. Needs help with teaching skills desprately."
8512,"thinks if you can't grasp the material (most of the class!) it's not his fault, he's ""presented it before, so if you don't get it, it's your problem"""
8670,"she cant teach, all she does is have other students explain the problems that she doesnt know how to do. she reads straight out of the book because she doesnt know the material."
8827,"Mr. Blaus only has one way of teaching things. If you don't understand that way, he won't try and teach it diffrently. He also expects you to know everything before hand and makes you feel stupid if you ask a question. Not really a good teacher but he's nice."
8985,I feel that he really doesn't teach and he never let's us know how are grades are he just gets upset with us which i don't understand?
9143,"Mr. Shearer is very enthusiastic about his classes however he is not very knowledgeable about the topics. He has been teaching physics for 25 years and still struggles to explain the most basic concepts. He answers questions with ""I never fully understood that"" and ""I cant answer that question you will have to look it up."" He has made a habit of leaving students without a full understanding of subjects because he is behind in the curriculum. I do not recommend any class with him ever."
9300,she can't even teach basic word processing concepts yet she used to to teach calculus (I know its mind boggling)
9458,"she talks way to fast, and just moves from one thing to another in a milosecond.(she hasn't helped me with spelling)her test has nothing to do with the material"
9616,She doesn't explain anything to her students. It is very hard to keep up with her nonsense. Not worth signing up for chinese.
9773,"Mr.Brenner is not a very good teacher. He doesn't makes things clear, and he doesn't give a very good study guide. He doesn't teach specific things very well and makes tests and quizzes a lot harder a"
9931,Just a bad experience lab quizzes are insane tests are extremely difficult
10088,"she is new, and likes her job a whole lot sometimes to much. She does not always explain stuff very well, and she can try to hard, to the point that it does not make sense anymore."
10246,"i think ms hennesy spends too much time working on the math behind chemistry and not enough of the concepts. i do great in the class itself and labs, but finals are killing me..."
10404,We spent a month on a project that was not even related to math. She didn't bother to teach the compacted math curriculum and now I am struggling because of her.
10561,I usually didn't turn in my homework back then but he just gave up on me in two weeks even though what I needed at the time was extra help he rarely explained stuff clearly he caters to athletes and only athletes leaving all others behind
10719,"Mr. Stephens seemed okay at the beginning of the year, but as the year went on, he slowly began to show his lack of algebra knowledge. When ""teaching"" us new concepts, he writes down a problem and has one of the genius kids answer it, then has us do a worksheet. For the tests, usually about 1/4 of the material was not covered in class. I'm a good math student, earning high A's normally, but I haven't gotten higher than a A- on his tests."
10877,she is so sweet as a person and hillarious but she's sooooooooooOOOoo confusing! The tests r soooo hard it makes my head boil and sizzle and fall off of it's socket. ughhhyyyyyyy. I can't take it anymore
11034,I'm used to teachers who truely know their material & I didn't understand most of her rants in class because they contradict each other. Ignore what you know & follow what she says
11192,"i don't like how she teaches, it makes the material hard to understand. it hurts mi head to think the way she teaches and it is no fun, all by the book. i wish anyone who has her luck and sanity!"
11350,"She does not explain things well, seems to enjoy embrassing students, and is very impatient. She does not prepare students well for her tests either."
11507,"Mrs. Burch is positively the worst teacher I have ever had. She is mysterious about what is on the tests, doesn't do her own problems correctly, and cannot admit when she is wrong. she knows the topic but clearly has no clue how to teach it to her students."
11665,"worst teacher i ever had. if you're good at math she loves you, but she WILL NOT help you or like you at all, OR treat you with respect if you can't manage to keep up. Her handwriting is worse than a two year olds and she expects you to read her handwritten homework and review sheets. avoid her at all costs."
11823,"She is a really nice person at heart but can't explain math for her life. She always makes mistakes on her examples so leave room for her corrections. She has booksmarts, but no common sense."
11980,Had him two years in a row for math enrichment. Failed his class a handful of times. Was too hard and gave a lot of class work every single day. His class did not benefit my math skills at all.
12138,"OK- lets be honest- some of us like her because she is EASY! We watch movies. That's how she teaches. Oh yeh, she also makes copies of notes for us. You only have a problem come regents time."
12295,She needs to understand us more and give more detentions. She gets very worked up often. Last year she threw things at students!
12453,a bit of a dim bulb this one. i had him for ips and chem years ago: i can imagine him doing well in administration.
12611,LIKE MATH IS NOT HARD ENOUGH FOR ME I GET STUCK WITH WOO.MATH TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE MATERIAL FUN OR ATLEAST WORTH LEARNING & SHE SO DOESNT.I HOPE 1DAY SHE GETS SOME
12768,She doesn't teach. She has us review homework problems with the class while she works on her does paperwork
12926,"When I was in 7th grade and was at Bernard , she was the worst teacher i had. No one liked her. She gave a lot of homework and never explained anything. When she did explain something I had to listen"
13084,He needs to lighten up a bit and take more understanding about his student's situation. He needs to be more clear about what he expects.
13241,"cant understand what shes saying. doesn't directly help you. never checks homework. ideal class for people who are good in math and just wanna chill. Shame on FHHS for still having her here,goodness."
13399,"Ms. Buttler, is, well, bad. She expects us to know so much, but barely teaches us. Her way of teaching is hard to understand, as if she isn't meant to be a 8th grade teacher. She's occasionally rude, even if she doesn't mean it, and grades HARD. No one likes her, as everyone falls asleep in her class. If she tried a more optimistic and interactive style of learning, and used the the textbook properly, maybe she could get a higher rating."
13557,"Decided right away that she did not like our class, and made class miserable. Would not listen to verbal arguements- try written one or proofs. Would diagram on the board with no verbal explanation"
13714,I do not like her at all. She doesn't explain well enough to students. I don't think she should be a teacher. She tells a lot of stories but I don't know how that relates to geometry. Like I want to learn.
13872,"Worst teacher ever. I regularly had to explain what she tried to teach to other students. And I did it in about 500% fewer words, too."
14029,"I took AP Chemistry for a trimester before dropping it in fear of utter failure 2nd tri, so my chemistry knowledge is easily enough for this General Chemistry course. Mr. Melendez does not have the best reputation among students. After a few months with him as my teacher, I understand where they are coming from. I often find myself correcting him, and people say I teach better than he does. He makes sense to me, but only because I'm used to more complex stuff. Also, he assigns too much homework."
14187,"there are some who teach to help kids w/ a subject of their own skill, & there are others who just want our vacation time.she's brilliant at math, but she's a presenter of information, not a ""teacher"""
14345,I think I learned more about her personal life than I did about Chem. She makes it a lot harder than it has to be.
14502,"Once she start talking to you, you get a STD just from looking at her. Someone please help me, cause she teaches 5th grade math."
14660,"This is the worst teacher you'll ever have at Valencia High. She can't teach, it's as simple as that. She makes easy material difficult somehow. Switch to any other math teacher, or risk wasting your time and your GPA. Carter is the opposite end of the spectrum: harsh but knows his stuff. She's lax and knows absolutely nothing about teaching."
14818,Ms. Tolbert is an awful teacher. She has favorites and if you're not her favorite then you're screwed. She teaches absolutely nothing. She assigns things without any clarity and then yells at the class for not understanding the assignment.
14975,"Probably one of the worst teachers I have ever had. If you don't like math or don't understand it, she gets annoyed and mad. She needs to learn how to talk to the students and teach in different ways."
15133,"cannot stand her right nowShe gets the professor to teach which is a video she puts on then pretends to answer your questions and expects you to understand everything, even worse on her only opt class"
15291,Mr. Trotta is by far the worst teacher I have ever had at Prep. It really says something about a teacher when students join together to petition against a teacher. He starts the class out being so lax about everything and then all of a sudden freaks out when no one takes his class seriously. He uses a textbook that makes no sense and is obsessed with a teaching method that makes no sense. Take me back to Ms. Ruggerio.
15448,"okay, so i thought she was going to be a great, helpful teacher.....NO. turns out : 1)waaaay too much work 2) thinks that english is our only class 3) tests are WWAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too difficult :("
15606,"I honestly just disliked Ms. Stewart a lot. Her class is boring, and she doesn't teach math well. She appears to have know a total amount of zero math. To top it off, she is disrespectful towards students. Ms. Stewart cannot teach math well, and she is not a nice person. However, her class is a joke. All she assigns is useless, but easy busy work. I didn't like her."
