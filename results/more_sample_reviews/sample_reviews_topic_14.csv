100,"Mrs Cerling is not a qualified woman to become the dean. Cocord's discipline will be gone, because nobody respects her. Hope they hire a good assistant dean."
200,"ego gets the best of him, i had him as a football coach and most of the guys including myself didnt have the best of experiences with him."
301,"can't coach worth a penny, doesn't recognize talent even if ronaldo was kicking him...poor work ethic, not qualified,not helpful, not funny, aliens don't exist!"
401,"Doesn't it seem that she wants to coach the ""winning"" team? Softball, Volleyball and now Basketball? Seems like what Flo wants Flo gets. WAKE UP FHS ADMIN!"
501,A fairly hypocritical principal. She yelled at us for getting up to throw trash away and then yelled at us for not throwing trash away.
602,She isn't the brighest teacher you have ever seen considering she lock herself out of her house/car in 10 degree weather. She isn't the best teacher ither.
702,"HEY RUSSIA! You were the best teacher ever!!! 'wake up sleeping beauties' 'where'da, geomabee go?' 'czecharoundchl, amzxwoiuerm, alkdn me0w.,m! ahahahah (typical russian phone call"
802,Ms. Wren has no idea what she is doing! Our school deserves to have a better (or at least more intelligent) principle. She threatened me and should be fired.
903,diver doesnt care about the students or what we think he took away the hat rule just when i was going into my freshman year and he ruined homecoming for everyon
1003,"If I'm right, one time, someone in my wing jumped out the window, ran around the school, and came back in through the door and she didn't know... or so I heard from a LOT of people..."
1103,"It is amazing that this ""Leader of our school"" is such a poor role model; he never smiles! Why not try to actually meet some of us rather then frown at us."
1204,"He should ride the short bus. I do not say this militously, but his first season as football coach, his JV team went 0-10."
1304,"He's taking away all the traditions that we have at Owen. That's totally wrong, especially considering that many of the teachers actully attended school at Owen"
1404,"Coach Ford is about the laziest human being on earth! He never taught a day I was there!! He sat at his computer, doing nothing every day. He doesn't care, because he thinks being a coach is enough. Why do we pay these people to be babysitters?"
1505,Has driven away many older teachers. Is unfair in dealings with students and faculty. Has hurt the reputation of the school.
1605,"They call this lady Cruella Deville,,,The only time she was seem to be friendly was at the Jr Sr prom and was she crocked,made a fool of herself . This lady is all materialistic not to be trusted.So sad to see false self asteam in an administrator ."
1705,HAS FAVORITES---UNLESS YOU'RE FAMILY IS MADE OF MONEY AND GOING TO DONATE TO THE SCHOOL--DON'T BOTHER WITH HER--SHE WON'T BOTHER WITH YOU!!!!
1806,It's just such a shame how much the program has gone down since he became director. Marching band used to be so much fun and now it's just miserable.
1906,Is unclear with things and makes decisions for other people. I mean seriously can I get a wine glass at prom????
2006,"Should have quit after sustaining massive head injuries. Horrible coach and teacher, but very nice guy. Poor role model"
2107,i don't care working for her either. there is no working with her because it's either her way or no way. it's going to be another dreadful year with her and the rest of the administration.
2207,"I dont like this guy. let lacrosse be a varsity sport already we passed a levy what else do you want? hes not a pleasent dude. seriously who spells ""kyle"" with a ""c"" anyway?"
2307,she a rude lady you are not a teacher nor a helful lady you are not to go around looking for ids you r to sit behind the desk and listen to your boss go on early matraitity leave please..
2408,worst teacher ive ever had! ONLY shows powerpoints. she is non-relational. GROSS warts on her arms. please get your tumors removed asap. oh and say etc. one more time and see what happens.
2508,"This is going way back. She hated me and my brother. The nunnery must not have wanted her in the convent, and now she is just a bitter religion teacher."
2608,How did she buck union seniority? There are so many other better-qualified teachers who are stuck in worse New Haven schools.
2709,"Hey kids, if this is the same Kevin Haney that taught at St Joes in Hammonton then look out. We loved him as a teacher and then he went online and talked behind everybody's back. He mocked the kids who loved him and said they were puppets eating out of his hand. He shamed students for being overweight or having acne. He seems cool but he is as fake as they get. Don't trust him."
2809,"I wish she retired, she's so lazy and doesn't teach music at all. To her she's just making herself look good."
2909,"If you're looking to be in the best marching band in town,then Mr. Kelley's your guy. But if a solid music education with clear, consistent parent notification is what you want..go to another school!"
3010,"He is never in his office and when you need to talk to him, he sends you to somebody else. The only people he's nice to are the athletes of the school."
3110,Mrs.Bacon rules the school. She is soo nice but sometimes she can be strict and all she does is turn on a telekast and has us watch it. She doesn't even teach.
3210,"we arent going to be ""super duper quiet"" so dont ask. putting our heads down on our desks isnt very good punishment either"
3311,"Well, she's a nice person and all...but when Japan is on the ""caribbean"" plate.....(of which there is none)...you gotta wonder...."
3411,I think Andy Fenoy of the Buckley School is the most useless teacher in the entire school. If someone would please fire him it being doing me a big favor. The amount of crap that he gives me is immense.
3511,"I ENJOY SOCCER, AND IT'S MY HOBBY... HER HOBBY IS YELLING AND SCREAMING!!! OMG!! BUY A 100 PACK EARPLUGS,KEEP EM IN YOUR LOCKER!!!!"
3612,Pretty much a waste of tax money - ! She never moved from her seat in the cafeteria! She didn't keep the halls clear or the noise down
3712,"i hate this man, he destroyed our band program. He sits there and ridules and is dead weight to the students work. And you wonder why everyone quits band???"
3812,Her class is pretty easy but rally doesn't teach. She allows us to do whatever at times. Too involved in her sports and brings her sports into class.
3913,"doesnt teach, always yells, and only supports the best of the best players, chasing away those who need actual help."
4013,I think Chuck is unfair in his coaching practices. He loves to intimidate his players as opposed to gaining their respect through his coaching techniques. He also loves to brag about what he owns.
