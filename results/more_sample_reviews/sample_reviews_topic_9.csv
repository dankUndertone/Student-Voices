113,"90% of the class is about himself, 10% is about physics. I learned more teaching myself than in his class. Unless you want your GPA to suffer, avoid his physics class at all costs!! It's sad that he is the only physics teacher in Gab. This guy should be fired and replaced,"
226,"ok, I learned nothing in this class and it was a waste of time. you have no clue how much I wanted to be transfered out of it. complete waste of my life."
340,"Worst teacher in history. If you want to have easy A, take Smryl's AP Physics Class. Don't take regular, because there is no difference between the two classes."
453,She does not do what she says she will. I did not learn anything from her the entire semester.
567,She's a terrible teacher. If you get her you should transfer out unless you want a long and stressful year.
680,you dont learn anything and she's oblivious to the cheating on tests that happen in her class. the class is so far behind in history compared to other classes
794,i learn nothing in her class....half the time i have to go on youtube or something to learn the material......
907,i didn't learn very much in his class we spent too much time talkign about the holocost and it is depressing. i wish he challenged me more. it was fun though.
1021,She doesn't understand that she has level classes and makes it PRE-AP English
1134,YOU BETTER LOVE VISUAL BASIC AND USING TEXTBOOKS CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU WILL DO IN THIS CLASS
1248,"Who ever is in his class. You better get extra help on English, cause You wont learn anything from his class."
1361,"Not very helpful. his classes are more exercises than actual teaching. i learned nothing during tham, except for stage combat second semester..."
1474,she didn't teach us at all. i am sorry that mrs. vuko had to leave. my freshmen year should have rocked. the class was wild and nothing was accomplished.
1588,"one of the easiest, most pointless classes ive ever taken...she has no control over classes and she seems to hate me just beacuse i have an A+ in her class..."
1701,She had no idea what the heck she was doing. She kept experimenting pointless projects that wasted time. I learned nothing.
1815,"Kirby has definitely created a legacy for himself. My older brother despised his class as much as I did. You learn nothing, and it's WAY to cold in his room."
1928,Unless you are planning to be in the plays or musical drop this class ASAP!!!!! He is horrrriiiiibbbbbllllle!
2042,"dont listen to all these people. she may be a good person, but her class is all busy work. YOU LEARN NOTHING! its is a waste of time and will ruin your life"
2155,"I hate her! I've had SO much trouble dealing with her that I'm transferring out of her class at the end of the semester, and even though that means I will go from IDS to Regular."
2269,"It's the easiest class ever, but that has nothing to do with the teacher. it's the most simple class with the most simple minded teacher. A one time she spent 7 minutes trying to get us to save a physical piece of paper to our documents in the computers. At least it's an easy A"
2382,"He may know about physics, but he is absolutely useless in explaining it. His exams cover things that we never went over in class and the entire class feels entirely unprepared to take the AP tet"
2496,"Very nice man, but one learns NOTHING in his class. It seemed cool when I had him, but now I know nothing about history"
2609,"Unless you want to do nothing, sign up for this class. For me, I wanted to learn something and get good grades (since his classes were really easy). In return I received tons of projects that have nothing to do with the course and a bad grade (comparatively).TL;DRget him if you want a free period, not for educationget on his good side so that you aren't biased again"
2723,She packs her class with busy work and has some ridiculous mood swings. I really wish i was learning more. At least she asks for help from other teachers.
2836,"I took her class as a freshman, and there was no doubt that I was smarter than her when it comes to math and common sense."
2949,"she's a terrible teacher, you do the same thing every week for the whole year and she's really confusing and you move really fast and dont take time to actually learn things like you did in middle school. it's awful"
3063,I do not enjoy her english classe because she assigns more home work than my AP World and Honours Chem classes combined. She things she teaches you things but its up to you to teach your self complete
3176,Mr. Gibson is nice...thats not the problem. He is very strict and doesn't help a lot. His class is reuining my whole freshman year... Thanks Mr. Gibson...
3290,"Wow. I took her honors chem class one year, and the next year, everyone in her class was unprepared for AP chem. wow. what a terrible teacher. we don't learn anything."
3403,"Her class is extremely easy... because you don't learn anything and she won't test you on much. Her exam questions are basic and very unhelpful. If you're aiming to get a 5 on the AP Physics 1 exam, you'll have to study on your own. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had; you won't be able to learn much in class. If you wish to truly be prepared for AP Physics C, I recommend that you take Physics Honors or get tutored. Don't waste your time in this ""challenging"" AP class."
3517,She is never there on time and we goof off a lot. I agree that a college prep class would have been a better choice than this class.
3630,You will learn nothing in her class. She thinks she is intelligent but she knows nothing and can't teach at all.
3744,"I didn't learn anything from his class, I had to find the information myself. I felt that a lot of time was wasted when it could have been spent teaching us the information we needed to know."
3857,"I did not like his English class. He would be better as a philosophy-type teacher than english. He does not answer your questions straight-forward. Also, his tests are very specific."
3971,"Johnson is not clear at all, and she doesnt even write notes for her advanced classes, I would recommend switching out of her class if you get her."
4084,All of the classes are the same. He needs to change up the curriculum to match the course. I should not have to study tractors in a flower class.
4198,If you want to quit your instrument- join her class. If you want to hate music- join her class. If you want to experience mental and physical torture- join her class. 'nuff said.
4311,"Took his AP Physics class. Homework consisted of writing down notes on videos he made on YouTube. Little to no learning in class. We usually completed problems on WebAssign with occasional help from him. All in all, he seemed more like a proctor than a true teacher"
4424,"Nice guy but horrible teacher. I had him for Physical Science and he was horrible. We did nothing in his class and when we did, we didn't learn anything..."
4538,sh'e so boring and definately has personal favourites.. i hated that class so much and would advise anybody to switch out of it to another level!!
