8,"i went to her in the writing center, she corrected my paper, when i typed her corrections, i showed it to my teacher, and she was like this paper doesnt make sense, you should go to the writing center"
17,"awful. she only knows whats in the text book. everyday she would project a page from the book on the screen and read it to us. she was an audiobook. when she graded, she just looked for key words that the book had."
26,"lectures full of information not found in the book. the test is entirely book-based. but you have to take notes, to hand in your notebook each chapter. smart."
35,All we do is take notes!!! and the worst part is that the notes are basically exactly whats written in the textbook. I feel like all we are doing is rewriting the textbook. Would not recommend her!
44,Essays everyday even though it's computer literacy. I haven't even written this much in my English class.
53,"Mr. Jones is the worst teacher I have ever had. Biology is supposed to be a ""lab science"" not completely powerpoints, videos, and lectures. Sure we've had labs, but all except one were modeling labs without actual data. Also other biology teachers teach way more information and have multiple dissections when we have had none."
62,Reads powerpoints that he did not even make off of Blackboard. I browse Reddit all during that hour I'm with him.
71,"I have him for comp/tech and all he does is checks his email, go on facebook and text. And he's to lazy to read all your papers so he gives you 100%."
80,"Needs to make the Knights Banner what it use to be w/O'Rourke. Doesn't check ""future journalist's"" grammer, spelling, and punctuations... Paper is now horrible!"
89,"i like her alot, but 1 problem-she barely writes any notes on hte board, and we need that-majority is visual..write more notes!!"
98,"all he ever does is make us take notes; do labs, and he makes really bad jokes. he also critizes our lab data during the lab down to the miniscule mistakes."
107,"I can't believe this lady's still teaching. She corrects grammar mistakes in quotes. IN QUOTES!! By the way, she's teaching gov+pol in lit + ARt of essay hnrs."
116,"This is a science teacher that was busted for showing creationism videos in class. Not good, not science."
125,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. TEACHER DOES NOT TEACH. LOVES THE TEXTBOOK. LOTS OF WORKSHEETS.
134,"Teaches from the book. Repeats self a lot and writes random, unrelated words on the board. Very, very picky about formatting."
143,"I don't know why but she thinks I'm an animal, I'm not a deer.I don't know if she is writing me a letter or what but im neither an animal nor a person to receive a letter from..."
152,"La peor profesora, no se los.recomiendo, es grosera e irrespetuosa, nada ense√±a y no merece ocupar ese puesto. MAL EJEMPLO.?"
161,y do u make us read a paragraph and then u read allover agen y do u put ur hand on ur hips? y don't u let us ask questions? y do u threaten to do things and never do it? y do u 4get so much?
170,She starts off with a section per week and now it's 2 sections per day. I teach my classmates in her class because she makes everything confusing. She just reads and copies the examples on the board rather than use her own examples. It's really hard to understand her.
179,This is the worst English teacher I have ever had. She made multiple grammar mistakes and did not even seem to read the essays or even any of the books we had to read. AWFUL.
188,"She just takes things from the textbook, and when she elabprates its just repeating what is in the textbook. shoot yourself."
197,"Mr. Perino. All your classes consist of reading, section reveiws, and labs. How about a bit of something different once in a while?"
206,She is an incredibly strict teacher. She writes notes on the board and takes them down halfway through when everybody is taking notes. She is just a very hard teacher.
215,"I can't beleive that he is still teaching. His ""lectures"" consisted of him reading the section to us!!!"
224,"No me gusta porque necesitamos hablar en espanol siempre, entonces, no entendemos nada. Si habla en ingles, nosotros vamos a aprender mas y hacer bien en los examens. En vez de, nosotros recibimos las malas notas y hacemos malos en el examen de AP."
233,All she does is read directly out of the book every single day; I can do that one my own--no need for her to waste my time.
242,"All she does is write the book onto the board, she has no teaching experience, and can't teach at all."
251,"awful. the day she gives us a huge lecture about proofreading, her handout of 11 journal prompts has 10 blatant typos. thats pretty much pavell for you."
260,Coach Wilson will not admit to a mistake. He also teaches the entire class off the power point notes. He will demand you to write more notes even if you print them.
269,"ok, he eats chalk, uses incorrect grammer, and once he tucked his shirt in and it stuck out of his OPEN fly."
278,"She is a bad teacher, that would always read off of the powerpoints. Most of the time she was looking at the screen instead of us."
287,I thought I was in a Computer Design class NOT a Resume Design class. Murga is an AIR HEAD when it comes to a computer. Help Mr.Williams!!
296,She doesnt teach the class what so ever if you have computer science don't recommend her at all
305,"I had him for advisory and he's kinda slow. We aleays get our handouts (field trip info., pic info., ect.) three days after they were supposed to be turned in."
314,"He got mad at me cuz I copied the overhead into the ""notebook"" like he asked me and everything was out of order. I copied it word for word in the order HE told me to."
323,He teaches us more about biodiesel than he does about probability and stats. He leads the league in tardies given. He also shows us pictures of mole rats.
332,"I had Ms. Sanders for Honors Chemistry. Let me put it his way: Ms. Sanders gets EVERYTHING from Ms.Ugalde and Ms.Ugalde gets EVERYTHING from the internet, even the notes."
341,"did not teach,,,,in order to pass, keep looking like you are reading or taking notes on what you are reading. if you don't,,,you fail"
350,"Not very good at all, doesn't really teach, just uses notes that cam with the book.... TAKES FOREVER TO GRADE!"
359,"i had him last year and he wrote notes on the board {really word for word from the textbook}. Nobody would copy them and we would all listen to our ipods, then he would ask us trivia questions!"
368,She just gets mad way too much. She don't even teach. She just gives us handouts and writes the notes on the board before class. She tells us to do to the work.
377,Um...we don't learn at all. She doesn't use intelligent words. She needs to elaborate on our readings because I'm teaching myself.
385,Ok so hes a so so guy..but you can barely understand him. The class is notes which we can find on the internet and reading.He hasnt lectured once

412,"Powerpoints, grouchiness, useless- these are the words that come to mind when thinking of Mr. Corraro."

457,"Nice person... easy class, but alot note taking and arts and crafts, which of course what science at William Penn is all about"
466,"Had her for two years of computer apps. I learned it, and that's what matters, right? A lot of teaching came from the course books, though,, instead of lecturing, or using the projector."
475,With Hudson's teaching methods even a third grader could be a history teacher. How hard is it to read some ancient notes off of a white board? SNORE
484,He stumbles over every word that he says and his hand is messed up. he cannot spell very well. and he makes you write 3 pages of notes everyday
493,He's not very helpful teacher. I've yet to see him write anything useful on the board. It's called notes! Some people can't just learn from those stupid papers.

574,"yeah she has no idea what she is doing....I was in her CompSci class and knew more than she did...if I remember correctly my favorite quote for her was, ""I thought they made VB.NET cuz VB6 couldnt access the internet"" ...dumb"
583,"Doesn't actually lecture and he makes you create powerpoints summarizing each chaper, so he doenst have to. If you get him for apush plan on reading half the book in the last month before the exam."

637,Mr Harris had huge favorites and didn't even teach that much he was to busy yelling at us

655,only looking to make a name for herself through her students. She makes us write letters to praise her ....ugh!
664,"M. Ford knows math, but does not understand how to pass that info to his students. Maybe he could write textbooks because he expects you to be able to open the text and do the work in front of you without any explanation from him."
673,It doesn't take much to do kOvacs job. All she does is make you read out of the textbooks and write 4 pages about it.
682,The worst English teacher I've ever had. She knows nothing about writing and specifies essay formats sentence by sentence.

700,Refused to use his interpreter to communicate with students. Forces you to answer questions word for word from text or else you will be docked points.
709,"I really did not like Mrs.Tien. She had a big grudge against me and had a real bias towards her favorites. She took off points when my powerpoint didn't have pictures, and when I presented it, it clearly did. She was also didn't treat me with much respect."
718,"Extremely lazy, makes you copy the entire textbook as notes, when he actually talks about math, it's just him reiterating the textbook. He grades notes based on neatness instead of the actual material, and he doesn't care if someone has a messy notes on a chapter yet aces the chapter test, he would still grade the notes low. While he copies notes, he browses the web or plays games on his iPad and his homework is all premade from the Bigideasmath website."
