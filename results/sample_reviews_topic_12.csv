98,"He is very boring and even has a monotone, sure it can be funny when he pokes fun, but (yawn) his class is pointless."
99,Mr. Patton didn't teach us anything besides the fact that book reports mean work and that movies are fun! It was incredibly easy.
100,Never teaches us anything. I havn't learned anything in her class. The only thing I learned in her class is that she stalks Gustavo Dudamel.... Dudamel... watch out for MRS. RIVERA..........

199,He's hella mean but hella funnie too. He don't really teach but his class is pretty easy. He is caring too so over all he's koo.
200,The class was very boring. It was coping notes for 90 minutes day after day. I just read the book and learned than in the class.
298,"It's been 3 weeks and ive learned a lot in all my other classes except this, chill class but this dude doesnt teach you anything.."
299,"This guy is boring, he is the most boring guy ever and all I learned in his class is that he is an boring. I usually just doodle because I know all the stuff he teaches already, he never catches me ev"

500,"Maybe it's just because I don't like science, but her class is unbelievably boring. It's the same thing; every day. Ugh."
598,"The class is really easy because there is a ton of extra credit and the material isn't bad, but she doesn't actually teach anything."
599,"he doesnt teach and you dont really do much of anything in his class, but once in a long while he likes to throw work at you without notice"
600,"She has NO rules basically. You can do WHATEVER you want. I didn't do ANYTHING but disrupt the class and use my phone and never once has she said anything. Class is unruly, you won't learn a thing."
698,i learned stuff but he never taught me anything just maps and books and movies. he just told us where to look
699,I had a lot of fun in this class mostly becasue of my friends in the class but she is a very interesting woman. Very weird but i enjoy her. Not a good teacher though

799,her classes are so easy. she never actually reads anything you hand in. but her stories are such .... she makes too much stuff up. and she's very conservative.

1300,don't hate her for the dog killer thing but her personality. sleep and cheat. thats how you pass the class.
