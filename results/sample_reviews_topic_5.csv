99,hes quizzes and tests have nothing to do with his study guides. I am sooo surprized i didnt fail his class ever.
100,she doesn't teach all we do is do worksheets and her test have nothing that she has taught us on them.
198,He gives tests on material that we haven't been taught and then gives us the packet with that info after the test
199,awful.takes out her agression with the people in the class by making the whole class suffer with pop quizes and tests that no one knows anything about
200,umm she didnt do anything..jus made us read the book and do section reviews and then we took testss..doesnt teach and is not helpful..
298,Horrible teacher. All he does is show videos every single class; he doesn't teach us at all. He also gives us quizzes before we learn the material.
299,"Had him for Bio last year, and he haven't teach me anything useful that helped me to through out the course, and all he tell the students are just to read the textbook for homework, so what's the point coming to his class anyway, if all we have to do it's to read the textbook.

498,"she is very unclear, also she does not give out study guides for final exams. She expects us to reread all 12 chapters and memorize for the final exam."
499,"she does not teach at all. she just gives notes on the overhead and homework. then, the next day, test."
500,"i luv mcdavid as a person, but reading 3 chapters form the book and taking a huge test over it by the end of the week is not learning!"
598,She doesnt really give us notes but when she does there r pages of them. Then she doesn't even use them on the test and we study our butts off to pass.
599,he lets kids cheat and then they get a 1 but if you refuse to cheat and dont get every single one of the coaching reviews done he gives you a 4. Even if you did great the rest of the class.
600,YOU WILL PASS HIS CLASS WITH 90S BUT YOU WILL FAIL THE REGENTS. HE DOESN'T TEACH AND GIVES YOU A LOT OF NOTES AND SOME WORK TO DO.
698,Transfer out if you can! Very unfair grader and will accuse you of cheating even when you do not! BEWARE!
699,"Coach Wilson will not admit to a mistake. He also teaches the entire class off the power point notes. He will demand you to write more notes even if you print them.

700,"WORST TEACHER EVER. She hasn't taught us anything. We are expected to learn everything at home and from the book. We don't even review in class. And her point system is rigged, making it very difficult to get higher than a B ."
798,"Schubart's a nice teacher, but he never taught. he'd play fantasy football all class. He wouldnt teach us, then he'd give tests on things we hadn't learned."
799,"Doesn't do anything, her lessons are someone else's lessons, no originality. Useless, you have to learn almost everything on your own. There's no point of asking her for help. Bring your book everyday and good luck."
800,She does not know how to teach. All she gives is worksheets and we go over them. I didn't learn the entire year.
898,"Not a fair teacher at all. Gives you busy work all the time and then expects you to know all the material. She gives very difficult tests when no one knows anything. My least favorite teacher.

899,Although she lets us take test and quizes over she still doesn't teach or answer questions so taking the test over doesnt make a difference we still odnt no it.
900,two years in a row!! i hope he does not teach 4honors. his tests include topics never taught in class
998,She is mean!She won't let us finish are test just because they take a while so we are all failing!!!!!!!!!!!
999,Skipped over parts assumming we covered them would give tests on info that was never taught. Very unorangized. help sessions were not helpful
1000,"Worst teacher. Trust me she is the actual devil of teaching every night we get about 2 hours of homework and she doesnÂ’t let us ask questions in class. Also, she expects us to just be able to read the textbook teach ourselves and then be tested on it the very next day.

1300,"Textbook, textbook, textbook. She tests you on stuff you never learned before and is very forgetful. You spend a majority of class writing lines and copying out of the textbook, then an oral test"
1398,He doen't teach anyhting!!! People just talk and do crossword puzzles during his class. If you don't read the textbook and study on your own YOU WILL FAIL!!!

1400,"he is a bad teacher that cannot explain and expects you to know everything. that is the reason we are in class! he makes his homework irrelevant to the topics we are learning and then expect us to review vocabulary on top of that. THAT IS WHAT HOMEWORK IS FOR! then in exams he puts things on that we didn't learn and expects us to just ""infer.""

1498,i had him in 2001-2002 school year and he didnt teach me anything.. he was funny but im surprised i didnt fail the assesment at the end of the year
1499,all we do in her class is sit at our desks and take notes into a notebook from her evil overhead. almost all of the 02-03 class almost failed.
1500,Mr. Lucas doesn't teach..to say the least..we just read do worksheets and then gives us random tests. Although the only thing he grades is test..
1598,"i don't even think this guy teaches. He basically puts together a bunch of power points, makes us copy whats written on them and quizzes us. That isn't constructive learning. u fail!"

1800,"Unpredictable and frustrating. For WHI Honors, he used Mr. Kraft's teaching materials, but the powerpoints were from a different year than the tests he used, which meant the tests introduced material we'd never seen. We didn't even cover everything we were supposed to before the SOL. If you want to pass exams, tests, or the Standards of Learning in his class, you'll have to do a lot of work learning material on your own from the textbook or from students with more consistent teachers.

1898,If she taught for more than 5 min.once a week didn't give 3 tests a week people would actually learn. She is so obsessed w/ her sacred routine its scary.I'm sorry if you get her!!!
1899,He is the worst teacher I have ever had. I have learned very little from him. He gave us a quiz on equador a day after he tought it to us and everyone bombed it except for some kids.

2100,"terrible teacher. doesnt teach you sqat, just gives you worksheets every single class. pray you dont get him, sorry Mr. Juell"
2498,Not very good at teaching the criteria and instead just reads the information out of the book which anyone can do. When it comes to helping also not good she wont help you in class and you have to go in after school to get help and during that time she just reads out of the book and does not go detail with it for you to understand. then a week later after starting a chapter she has a test when she taught you nothing about the information
2499,Coach Layne is cool and all but kinda inmature and just gives a bunch of notes but doesnt always teach very well
2500,"riddle me this, if this woman gives you an A every quarter...you would think that you would pass the A.P. exam...ummm apparently not. do yourself a favor and switch out immediately"
