18,"Why should we be in class if we're just going to ""blow the day"" as she says. This class has become a waste of time and I have learned nothing."
19,"Her class is an absolute waste of time. We do nothing in there. If she is trying to prepare us for the future, we must be challenged"
20,"Her class is a joke, her class is absolutely worthless. Her senior english class was easier than her freshman english class. I'm sorry if you ever have to have her, be ready for a boring class in which you will learn absolutely nothing."
98,Oh my god. The day we measured paragraphs in an AP Physics 2 class was the day I realized I would learn nothing with this teacher.
99,"Unless your child is going to major in geography, get them out of this class. It is much harder than comperable classes taught by other teachers."
100,"she's a teacher??!?!??! learned absolutely nothing in her class, in fact tought she was my study hall teacher!"
198,I dropped his class after the first semester and finished my senior English class with Mrs. Garrison as an independent study. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
199,"i had her for media (whatever that class was suppose to be), her class was so pointless... she just rambles on and on about absolutely nothing"
200,Is this man for real? He loves to show videos. Are you really a college graduate man? I can't imagine how low your gpa was. How low can this distrect go?
298,"I almost never knew what was going on or how it related to US history. Would've learned more if I had just taken a nap instead of taking this class.

299,"i dread going to his class everyday. It is not have difficult, just time consuming. Everything done in his class is busy work. He might know alot about marine bio, but he doesnt know much else"
300,I I learned nothing in her class other than she is an amazing writer( not) and what was up with all the favorites in my class it was soooooo obvious
398,"I read, did my work, and most of the class, including me made like a D in that class...and english is my best subject..."
399,She's the brand new ASL Teacher for both Vines and Plano Senior High. She teaches 7 clases at both ASL 1 and ASL 2 levels. She is deaf. It's hard to learn in her class because it's total immersion; she only signs and writes
400,I am not sure that I will learn much in this class. His grading for English class is not fair either.
498,"Ms. B knows nothing about Chem-phys. What I know I learned in middle school. I mostly unlearned in her class. Get your facts staright, Ms. B"
499,Dont like her but very easy class and class overall will not prepare you for bio grd 9 or chem grd 10 so on
500,his class was depressing. i wanted to look into a career in biology and was hoping that this class would help me decide but i didn't learn a single thing.

599,"he's a horrible teacher, but hilarious. loved him for a regular class, but wish I had learned something when I had him for AP"
600,He was litterally the worse teacher I have had in m entire highschool expierence. I learned absolutely nothing in the clas... The worst part was he is an honors teacher
698,"If you want to learn English, look elsewhere. Maeda = art. You won't learn vocab or how to write essays, but you will know your 19th century painters."
699,"The majority of the junior class went into the AP test extremely unprepared. This is due to the fact that we did not prepare for the test in class. Instead of preparing for the AP test, we were learning american history. We learned countless useless facts that did not benefit us on the test. i would like to point out that we did not write one single essay all year. None of us knew how to write the essays given to us on the Ap test. Thank you Mrs. Damon for a waste of a year. I don't recommend..

700,I wasted a year in math i learned nothing in his class him and mr armstrong are the same they act like they r still in middle school.
798,I learned NOTHING in his class. He didnt even finish the entire curriculum in the year! FAIL. His class was completely pointless.
799,"Literally cannot get above a C+ in this class and this is coming from a previously Straight A language arts student. Her language arts classes will do little more than destroy your GPA. Also not much language arts involved.

800,"You will learn nothing during an entire year of ""AP"" English. Bring something (or someone) to do so you don't get bored."
898,Mr. Packer is a terrible Honors English 11 teacher. He should just stick to teaching creative writing because then he wont have to prepare for anything serious i.e. the AP essay.
899,Ridiculous teacher. I had bronchitis when I was in her class and she did absolutely nothing to keep me going with everyone else. Changes her mind a lot. Don't let her scare you about soph classes.
900,"God am I glad that my mom is an english teacher, because I learned absolutely nothing in this class except how accept the necessity of english classes with an excess of busy work and little to no literary analysis.

998,I took two of his math classes and I am doing horrible in college math because I have learned nothing from him.
999,"Really the worst teacher I've ever had.I learned NOTHING in her class.I tried to switch out but all other classes were full. She's the reason I didn't take honors english 9th grade, a decision I regre"
1000,"Extremely worried about her class even in lower levels where people take it as an elective, not something they want to go into in life!"
1098,I love how electives can give more homework than all the other core classes. Leave it up to Ms. P. Except for that waste of a time math.
1099,ok she is really nice but if you want to learn something about social studies or english you're screwed
1100,"Mrs Blythe assigns 3 hours of homework every night. This is outrageous for a 9th grade English class and is not tolerable. She also grades all of papers and essays like it is a college course. She would be much better off teaching an AP or advanced English class for upperclassmen.

1198,"Lousy teacher. AP Psychology is supposed to be the easiest AP class... and yet out of my six AP classes, she's the only class I have less than an A in. Grades everything too slowly, not enough points."
1199,"Did not stay on task at all, learned nothing, then again it was basic English. She once took forty-five minutes to start class."
1200,Needs to retire. She just hands out the grades. Doesn't prepare for high school. Get out of her class or you will suffer in high school. I know/It happened to me.
1298,What we did in his class has done nothing for me in college. He never taught me because he was too busy favoring the Jews.
1299,"Ill make it simple. Because of you, I hope my senior year ends very quickly and I was really looking forward to it!"
1300,This class was such a joke. I can honestly say we did absolutely nothing at all the entire semester. It was an easy class but I do not feel like I learned anything!
1398,i so did not get anything from this class! and its english and ummm its kinda important if u have to have it all 4 years of high school!
1399,Engrains poor writing skills into kids. Most of the students that do well in his class score poorly on the AP exam. Take AP Lang with Doolan instead. You'll do less busywork and learn much much more.
1400,"Miserable miserable lady. Completely unclear in class, and unless you are in her comp class, you will really dislike her by the end of the year."
1498,"She taught psychology when I had taken it, and it was overall a nice experience. Sometimes a rowdy class would overtake the lesson plans, but nothing to complain about in the end."
1499,Mr. Klueh is the worst English teacher I have ever had. It took us 3 months to read just one book. He has no control over his class and it takes him 3 months to read essays.
1500,"I really didn't like him. I wasted a year in that class and learned more about non-history things such as cheese, etc. then our history."
1598,I hated this guy! It was the absolute worst possible class. I learned more spanish then chemistry because i hung out with the immigrants.
1599,"She is so hard I feel like instead of being in an 8th grade science class, I am taking a college course. She goes so fast that I don't learn anything."
1600,She needs to learn how to teach a good english class I think I have actully gotten worse at writing this year
1698,I had Mr. Lackas and I learned nothing. He does not prepare you for high school and he is not nice to anybody. I learned more from subs that don't know what they are doing in one day than I learned from him in a year.
1699,"You will absolutely learn nothing from that class and will regret ever having biology as a subject. She gives you homework and the next day you have a test on nothing you have ever learned. she tells you to study for things that are never on the test that she gives you. If you have her switch out of her class.

1700,"DUARTE IS DEFINATLY THE WORST TEACHER INSCHOOL, I LEARNED NOTHING ALL YEAR AND DEFINATLY DOESNT PREPARE YOU FOR HONORS Bi learned more about tatoos and rugby than math last yr!"
1798,"He is a very bad teacher, and he should be fired. I learned more in that summer course than all year in his class."
1799,"Ms. Navarro has absolutely no idea how to handle a Pre-AP class. To her, Pre-AP means grading as hard as possible and making the tests impossible. 3/10.

1800,"Had her home room freshman year, what a waste of time that was for me, I taught myself more then she ever taught me. Bad teacher sorry for being harsh."
1898,I had her freshman year for honors and hated her. She never taught us anything and just talked to us about General Hospital and what was in her PTA basket.
1899,"I've always had a trouble with history but this teacher made it absolutely harder than need be. I had him twice, for AP Euro and AP economics and both times I struggled to the point where I was only nearly passing. Personally, I don't like him as a person, even though there are some moments where he could be funny. But overall, I don't suggest taking his class unless you already know more than he does...

1900,"I learned more about dinosaurs, his family, and childhood than i did about math! If you are a serious student who actually wants to learn something, stay away!"
1998,zywica is a homework freak. don't tak any of her classes because she gives way too much homework. especially honors english and gifted seminar. she babbles on about nothing in class too
1999,"she is the worst teacher in the history of teachers. I am also a teacher but what i dont get is the way she grades... freshmans are not ready, to be prepared for college so she should calm dowwwnnnn.."
2000,"She wasn't a good teacher at all; she was let go at the end of my last year at Town. At least I got an A in her class, but she taught us nothing; I had much difficulty my next year in high school in"
2098,"Sometimes we waste whole periods doing nothing useful. I could've learned all the stuff she ""taught"" us in one day. Transfer out if you don't want to lose brain cells!"
2099,"overall a terrifying class, didnt learn what we should've but somehow everyone LOVED him.my theory is that he used subliminal mind control. he should lighten up"
2100,"Too random, i closed my eyes to take the cst world history test -_- i didnt learn anything! stick with your guitart!"
2498,"I had him my freshman year for History, and he was the worst teacher I have ever had! He was not meant to teach!"
2499,She gives out way too much homework. I believe she treats the 12R class as an AP class. If I intended to take an AP class I would have done so.
2500,Shes nice BUT WHAT IS SHE SAYING!?! I have no idea what is going on in Honors biology any time ever. She expect uas to know things..Suggestion for life: DO NOT take honors biology
