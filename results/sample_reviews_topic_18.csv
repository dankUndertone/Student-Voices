1100,"Reflecting on my year with David Cohen, I realized that I haven't learned anything new. Everyday is a new day of assigning another project or essay. First, David Cohen has the worst grading system known to man. It's so bizarre and he plays favorites, so if you don't click from day one, you ain't gonna get those 4s. Second, David Cohen is the single most frustrating human being on this planet.He doesn't communicate with us, he doesn't help his students understand the material and he's so biased.

1198,Is Very confusing on several subjects. I wish she had just a smidge less than three novels for us to write in one week.She could also be alot clearer. But nice
1199,"Doesn't understand how the school system works. Bad at teaching. Unconsiderate... Easy course, though."

1500,"Terrible. Her and her ""assistant"" are overly protestant about everything. Using google on the computer, printing out too many pages, talking, not sitting down, and many other things make this duo freak out.

1598,Really weak. Has no idea how to inspire his teachers. He allows them to place a very ugly backdrop to a wonderful school. He is like a snail who hides in a shell.
1599,"I don't know how he became a tech teacher, since tech teachers have to work with dangerous equipment. He seems like he's stoned."
1600,"If you get on his good side when you first enter the school, you will get good parts in the musicals."
1698,Agree with below post. Yoxsimer was recently demoted to teacher for alleged misconduct. Everyone should be wary of this man.
1699,"She was a complaining enthusiast. She complained every single class. I am not sure why, it was just an ordinary class. Her complaining took at least ten minutes out of every class, when information could have been taught.

1700,"easiest class ever, but i hate the man. with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns. the only thing i learned was how to memorize."
1798,He doesn't care about anything unless he benefits from it. I've known him for three years and he has always been that way.
1799,"She scarred my daughters. The amount of tears that they shed could cure Africa of drought! Clemson is the only thing she cares about. The sun was shining one morning and she told it to leave. That is gods creation and at a catholic high school I expect morning worships of the sun! My girls went to therapy and their mental state is still somewhat questionable! If anyone on this site knows a psychiatrist please feel free to contact me via this website! Ms. Lerner needs some too. Screw logs!

1898,"picks certain students out and makes that hour miserable for them every day... i've never been the one, but i've seen it happen first hand and it sucks."
1899,"Unorganized, unhelpful, professor that did not have class for the first couple weeks of school. When he finally decided to have class, he disregarded the textbook and googled all the information for the course. Normally I would be happy, but why should I be paying for a class for a professor that googles everything? I can do that myself for free. I would recommend NEVER taking a class with this man. He can not teach, and it will be a complete and utter waste of your time and money.

1998,"Highly questionable ethics.
Completely detached from his schools (unless you're at central campus, apparently), with disastrous results when he does decide to deign himself.
We can only hope that our school as a whole will ameliorate now that he's gone."
1999,"Mrs. Perez is so unorganized! Had her for CO-OP & she doesn't do her job. Liked having 2 hours off of school, hated the advisor."

2098,"Has little experience in computer science, almost as if he's learning along with the class while the TEALS volunteers do all the teaching for him. He favors women over men, and always treats them better.

2099,If your child misses class this teacher will not help you with make-up work. You have to repeatdly call and email and she still ignores you. The worst I have ever seen in 7 yrs.
2100,"haha, this is too funny, i had garner paine in the seventh grade back in the 98-99 school year. it looks like nothing has changed. she was definately one of the most difficult teachers i've ever had"
2498,"ugh i've had her for 3 years so far and she still calls me the wrong name, even tho i've corrected her so many times...she has no idea what she's talking about"
2499,other jazz band's in the city are just as good. she received the resources from weisser park and the kids did everything. not her. bad teacher.
2500,"Honesty I have gotten more emails from her saying ""Let me check that out"" or ""Ill get back to you"" because she really doesnt know a lot of things. Its great when your applying to schools and are down to the wire. Also just find a teacher in the building to talk to and not guidance, teachers are more human and if youre in their class you can end up with a higher grade.
