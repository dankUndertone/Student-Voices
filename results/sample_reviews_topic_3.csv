20,"He is cool. He seams like a teenager. He just relates well with the students. He gets off topic a lot, but that's what makes him so fun!"
98,"this teacher, ms. gando would always be on my case, always thought i was cutting or something, i didnt like her much, she realli kinda picked on me."
99,She acts more like a student than a teacher and has trouble controling her class or sticking to a lesson plan!
100,She is a young teacher who acts like she likes students in class... but then on evluations about the students she talks crap
198,i really dont like her at all. i can't wait to get out of that class. she's absolutely neurotic and a control freak..
199,I did not like her at all. She would always be absent and then blame it on my class that we were behind. She was soo mean.
200,"LOUD, doesn't dress or behave like my other teachers, a little too religious sometimes,class is like a free playground"
298,"He made the class very unfun. Its supposed to be choir, fun should be involved. He yelled way too much."
299,Not good. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Not helpful. Needs to help more. I didn't like the class
300,Okay so yeah he can be fun sometimes...but honestly he makes things too stressful! Gets way too into your personal business too!
398,"I do not like this teacher at all :( He is okay sometimes, but he choices favorites too much and doesnt care about the other students. He also makes you feel bad about yourself if you do wroung.:( ~~~"

498,Just got kicked out of class for forgetting to bring a handout to class. Freaks out over tiny details. Likes to take out his anger on his classes. Likes to brag about his punishments.
499,"if she thinks you don't try in class, she'll automatically hate you and not try very hard to help. very emotional. gets tired toward the end of the year and complains a lot about the class."
500,"i didnt really feel like she even wanted me there and she ignored me alot, ive had WAY netter teachers."
598,Uses terror pshcology on students which makes classroom very uncomfortable and unwelcoming. We constantly threatens people with the term do you want an F?
599,He singles out students that seem to be having the most trouble and humiliates them in front of the whole class. He gets an 'F' in my book
600,U are rude in the halls and to nice students. u act like u know everything and just look dumb for acting like that. Listen sometimes.
698,well i didn't like you one bit. You thought that we were in third grade. No one liked you in 8th grade.
699,"Oh my G you are such a bad teacher. You so never like act like you care. our papers are never handed back, you act like you are cool but you need to get real"
700,I personally feel that he chooses favorites. Even though I had a 102% in his class it always seemed he didn't like me. I did NOT appreciate him AT all.
798,He treats us like we should know all this stuff already and I'm afraid to ask questions because he just makes you feel really dumb.
799,"Never had her as a teacher, but she's been very rude to me in the past. If she'd stop with the phony attitude, people would like her."
800,"Dear Miss Lange, I'm not in 3rd grade so don't treat me like that. High School student should be treated somewhat like adults. Classclowns stay away."
898,She was a good teacher but now all she does is yell and make the class feel like were not doing anything. She doesn't seem to care anymore but the work has increased and she wont help anymore.
899,He wants to be the smartest in the class. Only does things that makes himself look good. Does not matter what he does to make himself look good!
900,i don't like her! like most the people in the school and the only people that do actually like her are the guys!
998,She is one of the worst teachers ever and would sometimes come in a bad mood and would take it out on her students
999,Terrible teacher he didn't do anything. It was cool to take advantage of his immature actions at first but it got old. He acted like he was a fifth grader trying to impress peopl
1000,"Mrs. Faszewski is a bad teacher. All she did was put me down. I was an athlete and I always tried hard in her class, yet she never respected me. She'll only like you if your are physically challenged."
1098,"Awful counselor, take it from me, I had her. She procrastinated to help students, and didn't really care about them."
1099,Favors the cool kids and acts like she's in middle school wish she would of just taught us instead of getting in everyone's business
1100,I did not like her at all. Not helpful. Treated me like I was stupid.She was disorganized and made learning way too complicated. A spaz and not a nice one.
1198,"Honestly, the only two things he's good at is making corney jokes and making his students feel incompotent."
1199,I was her student but the other 8th grade teacher's TA. It was hard seeing all the fun projects in my TA class versus Mrs. OT's class. She usually would give us
1200,MS HADLEY always picks favorites plus she is a hypocryte since she makes 12 year olds work out with real excersize equiptment when she looks like shes never worked out IN HER LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! she also overreacts and doesnt like you if you have an o
1298,"She's seems like a remotely smart person but she tries being friends with kids in class. She had no control over our class. kids would talk out and she would go along with it. She also has a bad habit of picking on kids in class. Picking on as in being mean. she also pits kids against each other to get a chuckle out the class. Overall bad teacher and doesn't care about most of her students. I dreaded going to this class.

1299,"Always late for class. Rules by intimidation. You must do as he says, not as he does. A lazy teacher, uses same overheads over and over. He acts like he really doesn't like kids."
1300,Wants to be a tough guy like harper of B.T but is just an angry little man. Tries to hard to be cool.

1698,"I don't have this teacher for an actualy class, but I am a member of her club. She is very unorganized and has no control over the members. I really feel like she needs to get control over everything."
1699,"She almost never comes out of her office to be with the kids of the school. It seems like she doesn't care about the kids, but no one knows since she's never around"
1700,she's scared of the kids. when we yell at her all she does is get someone else to take care of it. she don't want to really deal with us.

1899,"very vague, and amusing in a way that makes you feel something is amiss in her classes. something wrong in a scary way. seems uncollected."
1900,"Gives the impression that he's cool and on kids' side, but is actually conservative hardnose. Just because you ride a motorcyle does not make you cool, people."
1998,sh eis very nice but does nothing she is always frustrated when i need to pick my classes and acts like she has better thing\s to do...............its your job okay like she never helps you get the classes you would like
1999,Mrs. Espaillot has some very bad anger issues...she seems to like picking on kids and i dont like it. i think she likes me as a student but sometimes i just dont know. wev gotten in trouble because of things people have said about her. but over all i just flat put dont like her one bit!
2000,"She couldn't control the class, and wouldn't answer my questions. I didn't really like her and her class was a waste of time!"
2098,"I really like him, but he goes by his first judgement of you the entire year and never admits to making a mistake. He is very fun and cool, but he isn't always fair."
2099,does not like anybody. likes you if you help make him look good. used me for a competition and then was mean when it was over
2100,"Unfortunately she was not very good at keeping control of the class or teaching the material. I wanted to like her, but could not bring myself to."
2498,Worst Teacher ever! Everyone in the class didint care about don't like the way she teaches and her rude attitude to her students. She wants everything so perfect and homework it's so annoying. Worst teacher you can get do not recommend her!
2499,Verrry strict but at least the class is always under control. Lots of good and fun field trips and if you like the Beatles you'll love him
2500,Mr. Newman is ok. He doesn't have much control of the class and he's kind of fruity. Forgetful. I'd take him again though.
