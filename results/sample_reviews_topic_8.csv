20,"Her class might be better if she actually taught us herself, instead of letting videos and the textbook do it for her."

400,She is a completely incompetent teacher. She talks about irrelevent things and jumps around way too much!

798,"He means well, but has no grasp on how to convey material to students. Doesn't follow a lesson plan, which leads to him rambling for a whole class. But, at least he's incompetent and EASY."
799,"Watched a lot of videos (crash course). These videos went too fast. Since students didn't have background knowledge about certain topics, it was hard to follow and we didn't get much out of them. We were using the wrong textbook the whole year and let her know. She continued to use the wrong textbook, this made class more difficult and stressful for the students

898,"Mr. Regester is very knowledgable and great at Physics, however, he can not teach for his life. In fact, he doesn't teach any concepts in class, only through notes online; he cant answer questions. :("
899,most incompetent teacher ever. has good test results because the 15 students that stay in her class are motivated enough to teach themselves the material.
900,"Dont get me wrong - she is a very very nice person. Unfortunately, she does not seem to demonstrate a real knowledge of what she is teaching, or cannot demonstrate that to us."
998,"very unorthodox style of teaching, sits at her computer while students do worksheets, doesn't really teach the material at all."

1000,"Miss Botcher was a very confusing and unhelpful gym teacher, however she was an extremely organized athletic director."

1400,"Mr. McDonald is a weak teacher overall. His background in science is negligible, with a Literature degree under his belt from Gonzaga. The amount of content he covers over the course of his classes is small, and his inferior intelligence is visible amidst his frequent errors during HW corrections. His class is easy, but the combination of his unmotivated students, and his own lack of ability and knowledge contribute to a weak educational experience."
1498,"Frank Bunton is a self-projecting historian who uses his personal biases to distort the history, the small amounts he teaches, of the united states. Every class is a whirlpool of irrelevant and unhelpful information, which is following by incomprehensible tests based both on obscure facts that lay neither in our textbooks or in his lectures and on fictional movies he uses in class to replace his lack luster teaching. He is the epitome of inadequacy and I would never advocate for his teaching."
1499,Purcell isn't a very good teacher. He doesn't seem to understand the material that he's teaching. Stick with socializing!

1599,"She is very inteligent when it comes to Biology, but she cannot teach it whatsoever. She also cannot be proven wrong, even know the whole class disagrees, and can prove why."
1600,"I was really looking forward to Biology Accelerated this year, but was disappointed by this class. Ms. Sperdute was nice but want very knowledgeable. Her teaching methods weren't very effective either. Reading directly from slides and then giving us the slides to fill in as notes didn't teach any of us much. She was interested in her students' successes. However, I didn't learn much from her and needed to learn the material from supplemental sources.

1698,He is a genuine guy but lacks the ability to teach well. I had him last year and he was easily distracted and goes off subject. Somehow i was able to pass his class though.
1699,Knows her subject well but is not very personable and is easily offended. Lack of organization makes her class irritating and hard to follow.
1700,"honestly and solely on the basis of his teaching ability, he is the worst. he was unhelpful in and outside of the classroom. he clearly spends more time crafting his dull wit than his lessons."
1798,"Does not conform to the learning objectives. Forces kids to work on non-related topics. The entire social studies book and curriculum has to be managed by the parent. Her answer is this ""too bad""."
1799,"Ed Kreis is the definition of a glorified babysitter. This guy is so lazy he just reads to he kids when he's tired. He is really interested in running an outside business. Uses stairstep method for grading.

1800,AHHHH.....he is soooo off topic. And he doesn't teach what he's supposed to. Instead he teaches life lessons which are a bit uncalled for.
1898,horrible teacher and seemed over-consumed with attempting to assert her power. However much I hated her class (easily the worst class I have taken at lchs) she showed massive amounts of improvement
1899,i think he is a nonteaching teacher. he never teaches useful material...instead he makes the students learn from the book - the book is practically useless.
1900,"She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Most of what I learned in IB Math 2 was from my friends or self teaching. She is incredibly incompetent at teaching and is unable to answer difficult questions.

2098,"she was such a waste of taxpayers money...i didn't know that teaching involved her sitting at the teachers desk reading a novel, while Doyle actually had us doing constructive work where we actually learned!"
2099,Mrs. Young AKA Ms. Games is a pretty bad teacher. Teacher is hardly the word to use. Be prepared to learn 100% from your textbook and not from instruction!
2100,"I am a chemist by training and watched my child struggle through her class and, to be honest, she has no grasp of her subject's fundamentals."
2498,Mrs Fasano does not deserve to be called a teacher for the fact that she does not teach. There is no learning involved in her class only word for word memorization.
2499,"Learned nothing from the class. Does not explain material or answer questions clearly. No real enthusiasm. Choppy curriculum. Overall, awful teacher."
2500,"Very confusing teacher, does a poor job of preparing students for quizzes, tests, and exams
