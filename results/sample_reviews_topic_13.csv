100,i hated being in her class but when i was in the 7th grade and wasnt in her class anymore she was soooo nice to me! but if your in her class your screwed!
198,Shes nicd but not helpful at all! And she wants us to b so accurate! hated the class...nvr take it it brought my grade down.
199,"I couldn't wait until third cycle, so I could get out of his class! He was a nightmare. I could see that he was kind of trying to help us."
200,he seriosly does not help. i am glad that he is gone. believe me you do not want to be in his class! 0 stars to him

299,umm .. no habla espanol -- thats all i got out of your class in 6th grade and this being part of 7th :-P
300,"he's awful, esp. during scheduling. Last year, he FORGOT about scheduling completely. i had to keep going to his office and he's just said...scheduling...oh yea"
398,"She is the worse teacher ever my class started with 24 student and ended with 6 and 4 of 6 got Ds and the other 2 recived Bs because this was a retake class. promise you, you come to class everyday and complete a worksheet and she will not stay after for any reason but reccomends if you need help to see a tutor.

399,Dread having her as a sub every time. Would totally find a way to bail if I ever saw her in my next class.
400,"i once found her lying on the ground and thought she had passed out so i called for help, but once she woke up and said it was okay, yeah she's very bizarre"
498,"I wish I had any other counselor, she just doesn't get it- not helpful at all your senior year of high school. She is pretty nice though."
499,good 7th grade year bad 8th grade he totally gave up on your class just because we had a few bad kids so we did only fractions for the whole year when every1 already knew them
500,he doesnt teache he evene said flat out he was not gonna teach my class.... and he also said learning is supposed to b done at home not at school.....
598,"First bad rating, kids. He hated me and my friends. And actually, our whole class. But he gave me a good grade on the finl and I managed to get crdit for honors"
599,get out of her class while you can. she gave me good grades but made it difficult for me to enjoy what i came to this school for. (visual arts)
600,I thought mrs. moore was mean Mrs. Reese is 50 times worse now I wish I could go back to Mrs. Moore's class because Mrs. Reese will lie on people
698,I've heard rumors that she's fired. I guess 2011 to 2012 6th graders are lucky. I remember my friend telling me that she's horrible. I was lucky that time that I wasn't in her class.
699,"Mrs. Young was never a good counselor for me. She's never available, she doesn't put forth effort to help you with what you need!"
700,"He is not a good teacher and my son got a D in spanish.My son complains about him every day i hope this helps

798,I transfered into her class from a different state... and she really never helped me.. i had over a 100% in my other school ... then i came there and i had a C
799,Many have been misinformed about IMPORTANT information because of her. A few of us even recieved F's because she told us she would drop us and later refused
800,avoid at all costs. has few favorites and grades harshly to those that are non-favorites. it'd be a miracle if she could take a hint and retire already and let Ms. Rader take over. seriously. my avg. grade while Rader taught = A; my avg. grade while Underwood taught = C.
898,I went to her multiple times this year for help on course selections and I've gotten nothing out of our meetings.
899,Algebra I & Geometry: When I told her in 8th grade I am going into Geometry Honors she said she didn't recomend me and was surprised I got in! I got an A! HA!
900,"this teacher picks on favorites and drops your average even if you are helping out in the class a lot. even after I graduated this has left a negative impression of Russian for me.

998,"I missed a lot of AVID for doctors appointments and helped me catch up. If I wasn't there when they did the work, ""too bad, you should've been there."" Needless to say, I failed her class."
999,"just yells ""QUIET!"" and ""HUSH!"" all day. never gave out work, sat back and realized she couldn't control anyone in class, so she gave up."
1000,I hate her shes changing every thing that does not need to be changed and she is making people stay in summer school even if they have really good grades just becasue they didnt do good on there promt
1098,"I had Mrs. Lasson. She made everyone's life a living nightmare in her class. I'm just hoping she retires or gets fired so we don't have to put up with her anymore.

1099,"She's horrid. I went to her because I had problems with a fellow classmate and she pulled the other student in, made them say ""I'm sorry"" and that's it. I ended up just switching schools."
1100,I REALLY don't like Mrs.pondillo she lied on my interim and said i was missing assignments when i ha done all of them this quarter!!!!!!!!!!

1200,"Gave me the impression that he teaches at the beginning but as the semester went on, we have to teach ourselves. Everyone cheats in his class, he doesn't care."
1298,"He never helped my when i was in trouble back when i was in 8th grade. He always told me that he would handle the situation, but never did. we had to go up to the school officer for some cases. he needs to be FIRED!!!!!!!"
1299,Only detention I ever got in my academic career was with Ms. Orsborn and to this day I'm not even sure why I got it. Overall below average teacher. Senior classes walk all over her.
1300,I hate this guy... he picks favorites from the beginning of the year and sticks with them the entire school year... I know someone who had an 89.7 and got a B to someone with a 89.1 getting the A..
1398,"I found out years later that she told the entire class that she hated me. Now I may not be all that likeable, but that is very unprofessional of her to announce to the entire class!"
1399,"I was in her class the 1st year she taught. The 1st three days of Spanish she was our sub. She taught English to Spanish Speakers originally, not Spanish."
1400,"I hated this class because she didn't teach. If only a few kids got it, she would move on - never offered help outside of class, and if you needed it, she told you to ask your classmate."
1498,"this guy used to be nice about four years ago, but halfway through my sophmore year he began to choose favorites and i lost all respect for him."
1499,She is slowly taking away all freedoms in middle school the eighth graders only got one privalidge this year and that was after begging and pleading
1500,"she left one year too late. i got stuck with her and the only thing i learned was how to cheat. I did absolutly nothing and still got a B, NO JOKE"
1598,"Not a good teacher at all. You ask for help and she seemed to not care and I felt uncomfortable asking her for help. Difficult with grading. I got low 90s in her class, it brought my overall avg down"
1599,thanks for the memories. science has never been the same without you. i wish you taught me this year.
1600,she hasn't showed up for class 2 times so far! either that or she was at a meeting and 4got 2 hire a sub or tell the office to hire a sub!
1698,"umm the class was good until the last 2 quarters...she got really strict, and I think that half the class is failing...haha"
1699,"bad teacher i came almost 3 times a week after school to get extra help and she still could not be clear enough, get out of that class as soon as possible"
1700,"At first I thought she was a good teacher, but as the year went on, I realized that she never helps you and just gives you work that you have to figure out on your own without help"
1798,"horrible never grades anything, so you dont know if your going to pass the marking period till the last day. she doesnt help with anything, and is practicly death. she should not teach anymore"
1799,I'm glad that I'm good at math because you have taught me nothing this year. I feel sorry for my other classmates.
1800,She is the sub for mrs kohanic who was our sub for mrs burns and she is one big WACKO! she treats us like we are in preschool
1898,"I had this woman 01-02, I hated her so much. Her tests were impossible, i got 60's on them. i'm about to graduate HS, and i avg 95s on her hist tests now, she doesnt help prepare u"
1899,"Very mean. Wrote up our entire class once (granted we WERE the like the worst class ever, but still) and we all were going to get detentions unless we wrote an apology letter to her."
1900,"Most obnoxious sub on the face of the planet. I'm not at CSMS anymore, but I still remember failing a math test because she kept tapping her nails...*cringe*"
1998,"retired but sat in ap english class 2 days a week, tried to teach the class from back corner, interrupted whenever she wanted, was somehow still department head, now teaching again"
1999,doesnt cough know cough know cough how to cough controll cough the cough class. cough cough cough she should retire
2000,"I had Costley 4 years ago and she terrified me. She was funny, but when it came to teaching Algebra, she only let us do it one way, her way."
2098,"Let me just say Freshman year, he gave me a C, until I pushed myself to the limits to get a 81%. Not very helpful, and grades really hard."
2099,failed me freshman yr. bc i didnt write 2 pages for each class i was out...i had a medical excuse...didnt listen to wut i had 2 say
2100,It's almost as if you were talking to Ms. Cleo for math help. (only reason i thought the class was easy... i took it the year before)
2498,"I got my midterms - it only had 5 grades on it, and they were ALL academic achievement. She was ok last year, NOT now. I can't wait to get Broadhurst!"
2499,"I had no idea what was even going on in her class. In fact I barely even remember it, haha. That's not a good thing by the way."
2500,"i have 2 say, this teacher changed his ways at the end of 2005. he actually gave Medina a 7 for the quarter. I have 2 say that when I was in his class it was fun with Semonich."
