18,i think mr rozinski should become a bettter teaching by actullay listening to what the student has to say instead of assuming he knows what hes doing.
19,She doesn't teach well and you can't understand what she says when she's trying to teach. Needs to have more patience with the students.
20,She doesn't know anything and thinks she's still in high school. Well here's a tip Hoch: You're not in high school anymore! So stop pretending to be!
98,i thinks she does not know how to teach. she needs to stop worrying about what the the other students say about her and teach what she need to teach. she is so boring.
99,Mrs. J does need to learn a few more things about teaching but she was alot better than she used to be.
100,Maybe you should focus more on your students and not so much on your jealousy for Mr. Reese and worrying about those dang trophies!!!
198,"Does not help students just expects the students to know everything when they need help. Not a very good teacher at all actually.

200,she isnt very good at teaching. she doesnt let us back translate sso how are we expected to learn the french words.
298,"Ms beechum is a not a good teacher at all , I dont see how she is still teaching. She puts down students for anything and everything. Not clear and dosent help"
299,"She needs to learn to help her students actually understand her... because sometimes, i dunno if shes speaking english or hindi"
300,Mr. Libby doesn't really care what you have to say until you make it into All State. And he thinks he's right about EVERYTHING....when he's not!
398,"he shouldn't be teaching, he is too smart, he doesn't know how to teach us all the information that he knows, he is very helpful when you ask for it, but even then sometimes i still don't understand"
399,Mr. Dudely you are a cool teacher but you just need to teach more. The day you want to teach we don't understand because you never teach
400,She needs a reality check and needs to learn how to keep her personal life personal. I as a student could care less. She needs to learn how to teach.
498,Maybe he should stop trying to force his views on other people and stop thinking his way is the only right way. I think he is a fake priest.
499,"With Ms. Slayton it's all worksheets. She can't teach, and she cares way too much about what her students think..."
500,Um i think that this teacher should hit the sack... she needs to learn how to teach. or ever better how about she learn how to teach!!
598,"um,...yeah. i havent been able to understand anything that she says and i think that she shouldn't be teaching anymore. i don't like her at all."
599,"Mr, Ezekiel things he knows what he is talking and teaching about, but in all reality he has no clue. HE needs to teach out of the book. Not the old ""1978""stuf"
600,"She was nice, but didnt teacher well and just figured we already new everything she was supose to teach us"
698,he can't even speak with correct grammar let alone teach. he needs to get on that treadmill and read an english grammar book and maybe even sit in on a real english class
699,You are the worst spanish teacher ever. You don't know how to look at students needs and really help them with learning the language. Retire!!!!
700,"All I can say is thankgoodness we had Ms. Shade in the class teaching us too! Try not to worry about being so ""cool"" Mr. C"
798,"Her accent is so annoying. You can't understand her. She should know that learning a new language is hard, and that students cant learn it overnight!!!!"
799,"Needs to learn a better teaching method, no one understand what she is trying to say, we can not read minds"
800,Why is she teaching? Threatens student's with visits to the dean??? Is mean. Can't teach. Students know more than she does. Can't teach. Should be fired.
898,Do you even know Spanish? She also needs to take more control of her classroom..she focuses too much on behavior then anything else.
899,"She yells too much and doesn't know all that much. She couldn't do anything without Mrs. Vittese, and that's not saying much at all."
900,"No one even knows what her job is and she doesn't teach. The only thing she does is take people's phones away and that's not even what she's supposed to do.

999,She needs to retire and whoever hired her needs to retire 2 because clearly they don't know what their doing
1000,horrible at teaching. DOESNT TEACH. oh well..maybe its because she's a first year. but she still sucks at teaching.
1098,Keeps telling us that we're an honors class and how we aren't doing as well as we should be...doesn't that mean she needs to actually teach us something for a change?
1099,"This woman thinks that she knows everything and knows hardly anything. When she helps a student out, all she does is put her own drawings over it. She doesn't allow for any actual creativity."
1100,This teacher has some faults. such as talking too much about herself and not teaching her subject...what was it again? oh thats right! ENGLISH!
1198,"she doen't really explain ideas and lessons well and expects us the students to know everything, we're the students and she's the teachor she should do her job"
1199,It would be nice to have a Spanish teacher who could speak Spanish without making so many mistakes in the language that she is supposed to be teaching others.
1200,"He taught me German. Not very well, I might add. Just because you can speak it doesn't mean you should teach it."
1298,"not a very good teacher at all, she needs to learn how to teach better. And she needs to react better with stufents"
1299,He doesn't explain anything and much of everything he teach he doesn't understand his ownself. How am I suppose to learn anything.?
1300,"Ms Colon is cool but she doesnt really know what shes doing. She gets off topic, needs to stay out of her students business, cant accept that shes wrong, and barely taught me anything"
1398,He's a really cool guy but he just can't teach. I think he's way to smart to be a teacher and should be doing something else with physics.
1399,"He is a funny guy, but needs to concentrate more on teaching than his students personal life. He needs to teach more than assuming we know everything."
1400,He thinks that his students are janitors and he does absolutely nothing. He can't teach and you don't understand anything in that class!
1498,I do not think ms.griffin should be teaching and she needs to be more helpful and patient with her students. I think she is one of the worst teachers at Flushing High.
1499,"He either has no clue what he's teaching or he is just lazy. I think it's both. He never actually teaches anything. He just has us google stuff.

1500,"I don't think she knows spanish, she has given us fake words, and she expects us to know random spanish words she gives us without the definition."
1598,"Paulson doesn't know anything about her subject, all she does is make fantasies about her lizard and supermodels. Easy foreign a, but don't think of continuing spanish or learning."

1600,"she is supposed to be a spanish teacher, but she doesnt know any english. u dont learn v.much in her class b/c she tries 2 teach 6 different lessons in 1 day"
1698,His classwork were just lame and he thinks you know everything before he even teaches!! He's confusing himself in class and thinks we understand either way...

1700,"i thought in lab we are supposed to be learning science not whatever african language he speaks. besides that, hes aight."
1798,Worst teacher i have ever had. Everyday we just listen to her trying to teach us but no one understands. She teaches as if we already know what we're doing.
1799,"I think your teaching doesnt teach anyone anything, and you think your really funny, and your not at all."
1800,I hardly ever understand what he is saying. The only thing he cares about is the basketball team that he can't even coach.
1898,She cant teach math and she tries to relate to the students even though she has no idea what we are like.
1899,"ms henkel needs to get her priorities striaght, she needs to actually be in class maybe once a week and actually teach. u couldnt pay me to take her class again"
1900,She is ok. When you go to apply for a job and you need to know some spanish you will thank her for teaching you. The other teachers don't teach. I should no.
1998,she's a really bad teacher. Can't really teach. Dosent know how to teach a class or even spanish. Cant teach my grade or 6 and 8. Tells you about tests and quizzes 2 days before it and we haven't even learned that stuff yet.don't want her again
1999,she doesnt even seem to know about computers our I.T. guy knows more then her and he should be the one teaching us!
2000,i think mr.oneill is intelligent when it comes to the business world but when he speaks about sports the man is clueless and he is also very opinionated he thinks he knows everything no one on this planet knows everything
2098,She doesn't know anything about what she is teaching. You can ask her a question but you are better off trying to solve it yourself.
2099,"I feel she is nice...yet couldn't speak English to save her life. She is a good person, yet teaching wise, she doesn't know how. She can speak Spanish yet can't teach it."
2100,get up and teach please...some students want to learn! and please tell students from your previous years to stay out of the classroom while your TRYING to teach
2498,Needs to retire not effective at all. Has priorities all screwed up. Let poor personality get in the way of what he is being paid to do -- teach kids.
2499,"I know she tries... but she needs to go back to school. Can't sing, discipline, explain, teach, make decisions, or even socialize. I could do a better job."
2500,"Shola needs to learn how to speak English before being a sub I swear you cant understand what he says and its hard to take him serious. Also tries to snitch on bad kids(not good at it) but i guess hes nice
