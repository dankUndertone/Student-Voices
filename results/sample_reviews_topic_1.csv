18,He does not check the binders each quarter. He grades it first quarter and then gives it to you each quarter after. He has a fixed grade before you even hand in your work.
19,"extremely unorganized. she never makes it clear when projects are due, or won't even tell you about a project until 2 days before they're due."
20,"He is such a slow grader. He still hasn't graded essays from a month ago, even though he has had plenty of time over the numerous breaks."
98,"Everyone gets an 85% for class participation and homework - even if you do all homework, raise hands, etc.. Assigns papers that we work hard on- then decides not to collect them and add to grades."
99,"It's halfway through the year, and we have only had about two graded assignments returned to us. KEEP AWAY."
100,"She is so bad. She makes no guidelines on assignments and changes them when they are due.

198,"Terrible grading system. Only a few assignments are chosen, and there is no rubric to go by to ensure you'll get full credit. Even if you fufill all the necessary requirements, she'll write 10/10, but puts a different grade. It's completely random."
199,"She always loses your things, and when you come afterschool to make it up, she is usually not there. Or when she is there, she loses that stuff you did again."
200,"She does not tell how to do things, and gives huge homework assignments for a low number of points. She loves Nachos."
298,he assigns u projects and hw even if u dont have him for like a week. during the ela we werent supposed to have him for 3 days but he just comes into our homeroom and gives us this project -_-
299,"She does not give instructions well. She assigns projects and doesn't annouce when they will be due until a short amount of time before they are due. Don't get into an argument with her, even if you are correct, she won't listen to you and you will end up with a bad grade on whatever project you were arguing about."
300,She is 2 hard in her grading of the project! She was nice up untill i had to do a million extra credits to get my grade up!
398,"sesky is loses assignments, literally doesnt teach, gives too much work, doesnt check our work, expects too much of us, assigns different work for each period, puts grades in late, doesnt grade fair, and more. Overall unqualified oxford teacher :/"
399,"Terrible. Takes off points if you dont fill every single line of the page. Quality, not quantity. She should know that. Gives us useless assignments too."
400,he would always give us assignments and forget about them and gave us funky projects that were hard to understand.
498,She gave us a project to do in one night for HW. I was up until 12:30 and woke up an hour earlier to finish it. When she graded she looked at one page and the back and threw it in her pile of projects
499,"Curse his term paper assignment that makes no sense and ""is the most important part of your final grade."" Grrrrr."
500,"A Nightmere. All the assigned reading was boring, assignments were very unclear, she didn't tell you what she wanted, but then expected you to have everything."
598,"She changes deadlines and assigns too many asignments at once, then confuses which one is due when. She never describes course work and is generaly unorganized. It is impossible to get makeup work."
599,"horrible teacher, he gives us so much homework but never grades any of them on time or upgrades the grades on time."
600,"She breaks everything, then marks you down for it. Has unrealistic expectations, and your project must be exactly the way she wants it or it's no good."
698,I can not stand this lady at all! If you want to take any class with her! She is impossable and gives out to much homework and is very unclear about her assignments.

799,super confusing and give pointless assignments that he liked when he was in high school. he expected 9th graders to have a huge project due in 3 days...it turned out to be 11 days.
800,"Ms. Hammond looses things and claims that she doesn't. Keep your papers. Accoarding to Ms. Hammond, she is perfect. If you get her... drop the class."
898,Mquaid is evil she gives so much hw nothing makes sense! She gave tons of impossible hw on the first day and i h8 her!
899,"I once had Kerr for Honors English. Sheâs lazy and never assigns papers. Your grades are composed of tests on books, full of ambiguous plot questions. They are BS. The one time she assigned a paper, she just complained about how hard it was to grade them. She's unclear about the HW. In honors she says you should be independent and she doesn't tea"

998,mr north is cool but he gives too many notes and papers......don't give us a ten page paper.....too many notes......too many projects
999,Mrs. Kahn is not skilled in the field she teaches. She is very unclear on instructions. She is unreasonable when it comes to her grading and gives no time for makeup work.
1000,"She is the WORST teacher I have had at WMS. She complains and is unclear about everything. IN notebooks in Science are a farce. We have to do ""Extra Credit"" just to get a 100% on the IN notebook. There are many more examples."
1098,"Not very considerate because she doesn't tell you when everything is due. She is very disorganized and she is often gone or late.

1099,She is terrible. Picks favorites and gets ticked off and is pissy all class about the slightest instance of misbehavior. Yells a lot. Usually gives a ridiculous amount of homework that is very unclear
1100,"he often clumps large, time consuming projects together. this means that you are working on three different major assignments at the same time, and forces you to manage your time the way that he thinks you should. he makes assignment grades for different check-ins leading to the final due date, but does all of this without regard to any testing or field trips. even if there is standardized testing or AP, he will make it due anyways.

1198,not very clear. you're still wondering what the assignment is when you get out of class. and she gives out a ton of homework; i had to write a single spaced one page paper on my first day at school.
1199,"She should retire. very disorganized, marking us down for assisgnments that she ain't even assign. She been working for 2 long."
1200,she seems nice enough but she can't keep track of any of your work! I lost so many points last year on work I turned in and she lost. I wasn't too happy about that.
1298,"Way too much busy work: maps, booklets, Powerpoint pamphlets. A dozen projects related to Islam. Homework not posted on Edline until after dinnertime. What a hassle."
1299,"If it weren't for him , i probably would have a grade 5 percent higher. he slashes your hw here and there and gives you zeros all over the place. and he's incredibly stubborn."
1300,u either get an A or F in her class. so far shes d only teacher to get me a D. u hav NO idea how hard it is to get lower than 3.5 because of 1 ela grade. at least AR was to get about 700 points or so.
1398,"she litarally gave us 5 hr.s of hw over this weekend, every day i hve almost no hw in my other classes then i have hours in hers she likes to think we like her"
1399,He gives out about a 4 page packet every night and expects every one to do it in one night and he explains nothing!
1400,oh my gosh in health she tells you to copy down stuff and then the next day pop quizzes you on it! she assigns about three projects at a time. . . i cant wait untill gym!
1498,she is the hardest grader ever!! i always got the exact same grade on every essay..she also picks favorites and gives them better grades
1499,"Just the other day we were given an essay. However we don't have Kumar on Fridays so she gave us work that we needed the essay to do the next week she was absent. Then on Tuesday she asked to share our essays, which she never assigned. And we got 6 days to do a 3 week essay. Then on Tuesday she gave it back and half the class failed because she wasn't clear on what we were writing. Then she allowed the class to redo it in 2 days. And most of the class had to rewrite the whole thing. Perfect.

1500,Mrs. Warren is not a teacher... She just assigns work.. and then loses it. yah i am not a slacker and she loses it. how about where are the senior projects at?
1598,"Mr. P is nice, but not fair at grading assignments. He has daily assignment deadlines and if you miss it, that's half your grade. Don't get behind, even if you are sick, since the assignments are due in order and then you are screwed. It's hard to get ahead since he releases them when he is ready. You could be doing everything perfectly correct and end up with a C. Hope you get a different teacher. If you play a sport or do another activity, I suggest that you take the course online.

1599,"Often assigns homework late at night and without any instructions for the students. Tough grader, and is strict to take off points for homework that she assigned with do instruction on how to do it. Use her website often- it helps. You will need to see her for extra help. The labs are fun to do though."
1600,"He talks too much and is way too critical of essays. He also randomly gives unfair grades, either too high or too low!"
1698,oh. my. god. he is such a stamp grader. he always takes off 8 points on my essays and there's no criticism at all
1699,"(cont from last post) aggressively redistrubuted grades so everything was ""fair"" and equal. essentially, you'll have a D no matter how hard you work."
1700,a very shweet teacher! has work that makes no sense but other than that i love u mrs.sheets!!!! alwasy 5th pd
1798,"Got a D...Never posted hw, so you dont know what grade you have until its too late...

1799,"Her projects are fun, but she is very unorganized. Wrote due dates on the days the assignments were due. Had her for history too; there's a timeline gap in my brain. What middle ages?"
1800,"She makes us do projects on microsoft publisher and no one has that program, she also expects us to bake a cake for a grade?"
1898,"Basically if you have Ms. Dombro, you are screwed. She doesn't teach anything, assigns a mountain of homework, and also gives tests regularly. You might not worry about the homework since it is school policy that it can count for no more than 10% of your grade. However, she devised an idea to put all of her homework under a category named ""Coursework"" which counts for 40% of your grade. Most of her ""Coursework"" is given to you 4 minutes before class ends.

1899,she gives really long assignments and makes them due at the end of the hr or the next day she is mean and i dont like her!!!!
1900,She assigned a typed 1 page essay and made it due the next day. She didn't consider our other homework and classes. Some people might not have a computer at home.
1998,"2 days ago, she sent us e-mails telling us we have to do homework. Too unorganized to assign homework in class. So now I have to do 2 assignments for next day. I guess this is what u get when ur poor"
1999,She gives a lot of busy work and checks EVERYTHING in when none of the other English teachers do that. She treats us like we are 2nd graders by checking our annotations...
2000,Mr. Stuppy is a first year teacher at Atholton. He gives the kids too many chances. He needs to be more strict and follow deadlines.
2098,my sister had her and she grades unfairly gets angry if the parents send emails and gave my sister tons of homework. You don't want her.
2099,SHE IS A VERY hard teacher!!!!!!!!!! she just keeps giving and giving more and more work not even thinking u might have other teachers doing the same!
2100,"She doesnt know anything about how to use a computer, she complains a lot and puts a lot of added unnecessary work to projects which can be really stressful, some assigments are very easy but if you make one mistake she grades EXTREMELY tough."
2498,"She literally cannot grade and provide feedback. We took a scantron test over a month ago and it still has not been put in. The amount of points in our gradebook is about 20 percent of the other teachers.

2499,"Although Mr. Sheets doesnt give homework, he is a very unclear teacher and doesnt give directions well. He also picks favorites."
2500,"Thinks she's better than she really is. Doesn't give good directions. Does she really grade all those papers? I found many grammar mistakes she ""missed""."
