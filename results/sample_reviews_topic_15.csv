200,She's cool as a person but she's not the best teacher. She's probably looking at this but w/e. She's a really cool person!!!!!!!!!!

299,I have a B in her class and I usually get As in all the other P.E clases shes tough but really nice. But really ok not the greatest not the worst
300,She's a wonderful woman with an amazing personality and great sense of humor...but she simply doesn't teach anything.
398,I personaly think Mrs. Kopec is one of the most worstest teachers the bright side is if u survive here u can sevive anyone

598,He is really nice as a person though even though he isnt the a very good teacher because things are really confusing hes a nice guy and means well
599,I think that she is not a good teacher at all. She does not teach anything. She is okay as a person but when it comes to english she is not good. I like her as a woman but as a teacher she sucks.

899,Ms. Rojo is a really bad teacher. She is horrible. She is a nice person but she can not teach. I think she should go into making a math book and QUIT TEACHING!

1199,"goodbye, and good luck. nice lady, but you have to figure out everything for yourself. her idea of guidance isnt helping you with what you want, its making you do what she wants. best advice - do what you want no matter what she says, you definitely know better than she does."
1200,"As a person I think he's ok, but he's not ment to be a teacher, too strict on stuff especially uniforms and doesnt teach that great, kind of disorganized"

1398,"Not very smart for a teacher. Don't think she should be educating our youth.

1399,He's pretty good. But I think they should put people here who really want to teach instead of coaches who don't like doing it. But he's pretty good though.
1400,"She is poor at explaining things and can go on explaining things that do not matter. Nice person, just bad teacher."
1498,She is a great person but awful teacher. I'm not sure if it is her teaching or the concepts that are awful but I honestly feel bad for you if you have her. Good luck.

1600,yea i didnt like mrs clark...she wasnt a very good teacher but she is pretty nice. i just hate SS...i think theres no point in learning it.
1698,I had him in 2008-2009. He is a conceited teacher who thinks he is a much better teacher than he really is. He loves himself more than anything. I am glad I now have great teachers not like him.
1699,"I NEVER EVER WANT TO DO MATRICES AGAIN BECAUSE OF HIM he is not a good teacher and he doesnt connect with the students,he thinks he is God's gift to math...sorry mr d"
1700,"Umm... yeah. Really nice guy, really horrible teacher. I can NOT stay awake in his class, and I'm not sure he knows what he's talking about."
1798,"If you enjoy having all your questions asnwered with maybe, then this is the teacher for you! Great guy, funny, but could go up in the teaching area."

1800,Um hi im a teacher and i know alot... um no u really don't! ever wonder y u are one of the two teaching the class??
1898,"Becky is a moron. Plain and simple. Ditsy, moody, inattentive, and just a bad teacher. She's a nice person outside of class, but she definitely picked the wrong age group to teach"
1899,Mr. Harris is really nice but he isn't the best teacher. I have no idea what material we covered when he taught us. He also gave us the answers
1900,"She's a very nice teacher and a great person to talk to...but managing rowdy tenth graders and getting them to learn English 10, doesn't seem to be her forte."
1998,"I LOVE GREG FERRO!!!!! he is such an amazing and hilarious teacher. But, his teaching is awful. He has no idea what he is talking about, and when solving things in the board he usually dies it incorrectly. He's a great person, but not so great teacher.

1999,Mr. Aubrey is very different. You must find his good side and stay there. If you don't you will hate band. Good luck
2000,Very frustrating woman to deal with. Pretty much you better think what she thinks and do as she does. She is EXTREMELY wishy washy. All around pretty bad experience.
2098,"She's passive-agressive, controlling, plotting, and very unfair. There's no way to get on her good side and she's the only teacher I've ever had that I hate."
2099,"She treats us like we're too young. She has her moments where she can be cool, but overall isn't very good of a teacher."
2100,He's a really nice person but really needs to get in there are learn more about what he is suppose to do.
2498,"very hard to understand, and tests are soo hard. sure, he's a good guy. but not a good teacher. definitely not."
2499,"Yea, he is the hall monitor. But it's funny, he's never actually in the halls. He's outside or hanging out with some teachers."
2500,Whitney is an awesome and funny person. But his teaching styles are very one sided. He brainwashes his students into believing radical ideas.
