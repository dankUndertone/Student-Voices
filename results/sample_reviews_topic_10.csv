20,She never gives us help unless we tell her exactly what it is we don't get. How can we tell her what we don't get if we don't even know what it is?
98,"I can't understand anything he says and he gets his own problems wrong. When I say I don't get something, he just does it for me instead of showing me how to do it. Not helpful at all"
99,"Mrs. Harrell will not help you when asked, instead she will take the self-righteous and at times down-right violent approach of referring you to some vague point at which she ""already told you that."""
100,"You were not helpful to me as a teacher. You did not help me when I raised my hand to ask you a question. You said fix it on your own. You did NOT help me AT ALL.

300,He doesn't teach at all. When you ask him a question he just tells you to look it up and doesn't even answer it.
398,"She gets very off topic. She doesn't know how to explain anything. If you ask her a question she won't know how to answer it. If she tries to answer it, she won't answer your question. She will only c"
399,"She is REALLY irritating and shows way too much favoritism. For example, if we are going over a multiple choice question as a class, she would choose the wrong answer choice and try to convince us it's right. When we start arguing with her she checks the question and it turns out SHE was wrong. Also, whenever you ask her a question she ALWAYS has to ask the other teachers and never gets back to you on it.

699,Wasn't too fond of her. She would never help me when I asked questions. She basically wanted me to remember how to do everyithng or figure it out on my own.

898,"all he does is give a WS and leave the room! when you ask a question he tells you to figure it out one your own, even if you ahve no clue!"
899,"While taking a test, simply go up to him and ask if you got a question right, and if you didn't he'll tell you the correct answer. Easy A . He tells you something once and expects you to get it. I did"
900,if u actually listen to what she says its unclear and not intelligent and she never knows what to say to you if you are having a problem in her class i do not like her
998,"Mrs. price won't really help you. If you ask her a question, she'll just tell you to check the textbook or the notes. When a student asks for clarification, it means they don't understand the book or notes, so saying check the notes doesn't really help much.

2500,"He's a misunderstood guy - his class is simple once you get how he teaches, and realize that he gives you the answer most of the time. Just ask if he's not clear,but you might be stuck for a few min."
