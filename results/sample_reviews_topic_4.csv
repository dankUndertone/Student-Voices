198,"Ms. O'Neill is not the best at teaching. She is a very fast paced teacher and we all told her to slow down but she never does. It's very frustrating. She also doesn't do a good job at explaining how to do problems. When she tried to explain it it made me more confused.

1198,She seem to stay one day ahead of her math classes. She was so confusing that some of her students began to teach themselves or had tutors help them.
1199,"He doesn't even teach well, horrible teacher. Many smart people even struggle with his test because they're so hard and he doesn't teach the material. Take this class if you're only good at self-study"
1200,"Absolutely Horrible teacher. Doesn't explain things right the first time, only explains them right when you don't understand your homework. She also takes forever to explain things that only one person is confused about, and takes 30 seconds to explain the stuff no one understands. About 80% of the time I leave her class confused about what she taught and I'm a very intelligent student. TERRIBLE!!

1298,I would suggest that you get a tutor if you're taking math with him. The book teaches better than he does
