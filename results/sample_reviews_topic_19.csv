18,"She states her personal opinions as facts, making it hard for students to make up their own mind about events and ideas in the world."
19,Lets be real here Mr. E. Koca is like a normal guy high on a mix of steroids with anger management issues
20,Ms.Novy had a tendency to not value the opinions or beliefs of her students and if it's not in the text book it's not right

198,"The twins, the twins, the twins, Nic and Alex, Nic and Alex, Nic and Alex... Can she talk about anything else?"
199,Why would anyone in their right mind would wanna hire NEY. he talk too much about unrealated subject and he's a hypocrite.
200,I was offended by her constant references to her religion. Why hasn't the administration told her that the constitutional separation between church and state applies to her as well as to the rest of the country.
298,"Mr. Roney is a decent guy but his grading system is not realistic. He need to get a grip on what the students need in current society, not what was 25 yrs ago."
299,"He sometimes teaches things that he believes is the truth and it is not, he has a strong tendancy to contradict himself often"
300,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a be should be able to fly. However a bee flys anyway because they don care what human? think is impossible.

399,i dont like her...she supposed to teach art but she made us read n write everyday. we only drew 1 picture in the whole term.
400,"Spanic Dips**t
Go back to your country of origin or i'll hunt you with my skinhead group you hispanic blowj**"
498,"Should not be allowed to teach, she pushes her personal opinions in the name of freedom of speech, an activist in the classroom

598,"He is the worst...He has favorites, he wore a cat in the suit at graduation and when we got an award he dropped it and broke the glass fraqme...so repesctful"
599,"Unclear with what she wants. Too interested in the social aspect of school. Plays favorites. WAY to critical of others' religious views (not me, I'm unaffiliated but she still makes people feel uneasy with her anti religious views). Also, not challenging."
600,"Her class is NOT helpful and the red-pencil exercise is the most pointless thing imaginable. She is a biased educator, sux for us who don't share her views!"
698,"I had her a few years ago, and she pushes her political propaganda throughout her classes. People like this have an agenda and should not be teachers.

699,"Worst art teacher in the world. She never explained well and even if we made a small, careless mistake on our art, she'll yell and criticize. Btw this art class is boring so good luck.

700,"If you were too honest and told her what you thought, and it was something she did not like, she made you pay for it. She would grade you much more harshly as a result."
798,Agree with rater on 4/26/03 that she needs to teach in Tehachapi. She is not a good value for your Garces tuition.
799,With the exeception of French she has no clue what she is talking about. She is off in some imaginary land where the ditsy faries roam. Very inconsistant grad
800,"Who hated this planet enough to let this horrible creature spread her seed

898,"He needs to rethink whats good for an AP art portfolio, b/c some of us were certainly mislead with our concentrations."
899,hes annoying and it is soo hard to get a good grade in his class he needs to not care i mean no 1 cares if u kno how to draw a cell perfectly it isnt art
900,Plays the bigest favorites ever! Unwilling to see any point of view but her own. Critical and has a large holier than thou attitude. Unfair grader. Doesn't teach us anything.
998,"Very rude. Only talks about how old she is and how her children are better than you. She doesn't grade art based on creativity. If you have her, good luck!

999,"Respect him for going to Iraq. Howerver as a teacher, he is off base. Why a Halloween Melody during the holiday program? Why do you yell like a drill sargent?"
1000,didnt give us our 5 min break b/t lab and puts off answering my questions! had to fly thru 5 or more chapters b/c she spent so much time on evolution which was the easiest topic not the hardest!! SUX!
1098,okay if you get kenney switch out immediatly what i hate about her is the fact that she doesnt like anyone else's opinion but her own. Everyone is wrong except for her and she makes it very clear in class.
1099,"She's unclear, unhelpful, and doesn't teach. She has a liberal agenda to push. I didn't learn or gain a thing from this class. She becomes intimidated by smarter students. If you get her, switch..."
1100,She is the worst possible candidate for an art teacher. She is totally biased when it comes to art and has openly vilified modern art. She uses students to clean her room and put together furniture. She's inappropriately mean and doesn't explain things well at all. I only think the school keeps her on staff because she puts in a huge amount of work on school events and fundraisers. These things actually get in the way of her teaching. Overall just a bad teacher.
1198,"Mr Fine is an awful teacher. I'm surprised to find so many good reveiws on here. We learn nothing, needs to keep opinions to himself, gives ""lines"" (out of date punishment? yes) and tells bad jokes"
1199,"She's so condescending and plays favorites. I had her last year for two classes and will never take them again.Horrible discipline- if one person acts out she'll have the entire class take punishment.I love art but i hate her class. She can't even draw and thinks her ""modern art"" is better than everyone.

1200,"Mrs. Fitzsimons is an overall bad teacher. To speak in teenage terms, she has gotten slightly 'chiller' in the past week or two. I might like to stirr up a bit of trouble in her class, yet I understand most of the material she gives out. She is annoying; and DOES shoot down questions that oppose her mindset, as others have said. She should stop doing this stupid method of vocab, as we are preparing for SAT level words, and she is making up the definitions for them :( Peace, brahhs"
