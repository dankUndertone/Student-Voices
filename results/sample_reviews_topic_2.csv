998,"Mrs. Gawron, where do I begin? She seems very nice at first glance, yet, as the year progresses, one will realize how much of a fa√ßade this is. Mrs. Gawron had a tendency to bring inappropriate matters in to the classroom, for example, one day she brought in her sister in order to discuss financial matters that made the entire class uncomfortable due to the fact that this was unexpected and unanticipated. This served no purpose to our education and frankly, was borderline offensive.

She's has no regard for others and by holding what she probably believes are just high expectations with strict consequences, she is breaking the students.

If u are struggling with home life or any other class, forget about trying to have a good day. She has no regard for ur wellbeing.

1599,"Karen Curtis is perhaps the single worst educator i have ever had the misfortune of being under the tutelage of. She is completely incapable of answering even the simplest question, and refuses to put forth even the minimum effort to make sure her students are successful. She claims to have been ""an accountant by trade"", and for the sake of all the children to have happened to find themselves in her classroom, i wish that she could have remained so. This woman is Satan. Don't take this class.

He would make comment about my son's sexuality and my daughter's endowment. I tried meeting with him, but he was conviently never available because he was a coach. He did not return my phone calls or emails. My children went to a former teacher to get him.
